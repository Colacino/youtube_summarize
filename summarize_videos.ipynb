Using vector clock we can do this using a strong ordering, which we use in which we increment, in which two things happen in two places. We don't need to order messages that are connected by an offense before relationship, but those that are in an ordering with the vector clock ordering. The two messages are parallel, so the ordering is not relevant for us. So it tries and succeeds in ordering messages, even if they are not parallel. Tries to order broadcast, the totally ordered broadcast, tries to order them in a certain certain order, and then then the second or vice versa for all of us.

Then you come back, you give me back the token, the token that gives you the right to print. And then I know that the printer is free, and I can give the token to the second process, and so on so forth. This is the idea of having a centralized process that It is not printing, it does not hold the resource, so it's not printing.

Lemport is based on the idea of a leader, a single process that coordinates the action of other processes, and a color cloth that can be used to represent the color of the color cloth. For a centralized solution, if the coordinator crash, we have a problem. But for the lamp work solution,  if any process crash, We have a Problem. And for the token ring solution, for the Token Ring solution, If any process crashes, We Have A Problem. We assume that the system is closed. So we assume that all processes knows the group within with the agreement must happen. So the duration of the protocol remains stable for each group. If there are crashes, we want that no processes enter the group. Processes entering the group may crash for election, because it's exactly the situation that we want to call it.\"}]\n",

Ring is a structure as you discovered, probably understood during the course. In order to implement proper rules, we may also use a logical ring. We assume a process detects a failure of the leader, it sends an elect message containing its own ID to the closest neighbor that is still available. At the same time, two and five discovered that seven crashed, so two sends an election message to three. Three circulates the message adding its ownID to three with its own message. The bully wins.

The only important thing is that everyone choose the same. The system proceeds this way with those two tokens that circulate in parallel. parallel. It would like to take a picture of the system, and what you would like is a picture like the one we can obtain here. So what we can do here is to observe the entire system in zero time, so have a perfect view of the whole system. But God does not exist, so this picture may not exist. We can compare the two algorithms, I'll leave this to you. Global state, collecting global state, and then termination detection.

A cut is consistent if for every two events, e and f, where e is part of the cut and f happens before e, this is the happens before relationship.

So when a process starts the snapshot, it takes its own state and emits a special message on all outgoing channels that it has done something. So we are in a situation in which processes are doing something like the banks before the banks. They are connected by channels that communicate by the various action channels, so we will see each channel with its own direction. Some of them will be by action or not, so the marker of the marker, the marker on the outgoing channels, is the marker for the action channel.

            "[12:50.320 --> 12:56.720]  But the one that really matters is we pour all of this effort and money and time into this thing\n",

            "[14:16.720 --> 14:22.720]  You know a funny thing about the way we're training these models is I suspect too much\n",
            "[14:22.720 --> 14:29.680]  of the processing power for lack of a better word is going into using the models of database\n",

            "[14:43.600 --> 14:48.480]  kind of reasoning and you know maybe like the scholars and the experts and like the armchair\n",
            "[14:48.480 --> 14:53.280]  quarterbacks on Twitter would say no it can't you're misusing the word you know whatever whatever\n",
            "[14:53.280 --> 14:58.240]  but I think most people who have used this system would say okay it's doing something in this direction\n",
            "[14:58.960 --> 15:08.080]  and I think that's remarkable and the thing that's most exciting and somehow out of\n",
            "[15:09.680 --> 15:16.080]  ingesting human knowledge it's coming up with this reasoning and capability however we're going\n",
            "[15:16.160 --> 15:23.600]  to talk about that. Now in some senses I think that will be additive to human wisdom and in some\n",
            "[15:23.600 --> 15:28.240]  other senses you can use GPT-4 for all kinds of things and say that appears that there's no wisdom\n",
            "[15:28.240 --> 15:34.320]  in here whatsoever. Yeah at least in interaction with humans it seems to possess wisdom especially\n",

            "[15:50.240 --> 15:56.000]  challenge incorrect premises and reject inappropriate requests but also there's a feeling like it's\n",
            "[15:56.000 --> 16:01.760]  struggling with ideas. Yeah it's always tempting to anthropomorphize this stuff too much but I also\n",
            "[16:01.760 --> 16:08.080]  feel that way. Maybe I'll take a small tangent towards Jordan Peterson who posted on Twitter\n",

            "[16:15.600 --> 16:21.680]  right like the different directions you want to try the dark thing. It somehow says a lot about\n",
            "[16:21.680 --> 16:28.480]  people the first thing. Oh no oh no we don't we don't have to reveal what I asked. We do not.\n",
            "[16:29.280 --> 16:37.120]  I of course ask mathematical questions I've never asked anything dark but Jordan asked it to say\n",
            "[16:37.200 --> 16:43.280]  positive things about the current president Joe Biden and previous president Donald Trump and then\n",
            "[16:44.880 --> 16:52.240]  he asked GPT as a follow-up to say how many characters how long is the string that you generated and he\n",

            "[18:16.640 --> 18:22.000]  of the things that seem like they should be obvious and easy these models really struggle with yeah\n",
