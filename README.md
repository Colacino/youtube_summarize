# Summarize videos for free in Google Colab 

Effortlessly summarize videos from multiple sources (youtube, dropbox and google drive) in Google Colab (free GPU tier) using state-of-the-art AI models [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) and **Mixtral 8x7b** for **free** through [Groq cloud API](https://wow.groq.com/). 

### Use cases 

- You don't want to watch a lengthy video podcast and want a summary with timestamps to get a precise overview of the content.
- To efficiently take notes on a video, relying on a summary that captures key points with timestamps. 

This project offers a free alternative to [summarize.tech](https://www.summarize.tech/) for unlimited video summaries. However, summarize.tech and its 5 free daily videos remains faster for quick overviews. 
Said this, this notebook provides:

- Not limited to YouTube videos (dropbox and gdrive links)
- More precise and complete results
- Original transcript
