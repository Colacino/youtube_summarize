        "Source = \"The following is a conversation with Jared Kushner, former senior advisor to the President during the Donald Trump administration and author of Breaking History, A White House memoir. He\\u2019s one of the most influential and effective presidential advisors in modern history, helping conduct negotiations with some of the most powerful leaders in the world and deliver results on trade, criminal justice reform, and historic progress towards peace in the Middle East. On Thursday, October 5th, we recorded conversation on topics of war and peace, history and power in the Middle East and beyond. This was about a day and a half before the Hamas attack on Israel, and then we felt we must sit down again on Monday, October 9th and add a discussion on the current situation. We open the podcast with a second newly recorded part. My heart goes out to everyone who has and is suffering in this war. I pray for your strength and for the long-term peace and flourishing of the Israeli and Palestinian people. I love you all. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. And now, dear friends, here\\u2019s Jared Kushner. Hamas attack on Israel  (00:01:17) We did a lot of this conversation before the Hamas attack on Israel, and we decided to sit down again and finish the discussion to address the current situation which is still developing. If I may allow me to summarize the situation as it stands today, it\\u2019s morning Monday, October 9th. On Saturday, October 7th at 6:30 AM Israel time, Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Southern Israel. The rocket attacks served as cover for a multi-pronged infiltration of Israel territory by over 1000 Hamas militants. This is shortly after at 7:40 AM.  (00:01:55) The Hamas militants went door to door in border towns killing civilians and taking captives, including women and children. In response to this, Israeli Air Force began carrying out strikes in Gaza, also fighting on the ground in Israel to clear out Hamas militants from Israel territory and preparing to mobilize Israeli troops for potential ground attack on Hamas and Gaza. Now, of course, this is what it appears to be right now, and this along with other things might change because the situation is still developing. The IDF is ordering civilian residents of Gaza to evacuate their homes for their safety. Benjamin Netanyahu declared war in several statements and warned Israelis to brace themselves for a long and difficult war. Just today, Israeli ministers ordered a \\u201Ccomplete siege of Gaza interrupting supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel from Israel to Gaza.\\u201D As of now, October 9th, the death toll is over 1200 people and over 130 hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas. As I said, the events are rapidly unfolding, so these numbers will sadly increase, but hopefully our words here can at least in part, speak to the timeless underlying currents of the history and as you write about the power dynamics of the region. For people who don\\u2019t know, Gaza is a 25 miles long, six miles wide strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Israel on the east and north and Egypt on the southwest. It\\u2019s densely populated, about 2.3 million people, and there\\u2019s been a blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt since 2007 when Hamas took power. I could just summarize that Hamas is a Palestinian militant group which rules the Gaza Strip. It originated in 1988, and it came to power in Gaza in 2006. As part of its charter, it\\u2019s sworn to the destruction of Israel, and it is designated by the United States, European Union, UK, and of course Israel as a terrorist group. Response to attack  (00:04:10) Given that context, what are your feelings as a human being and what is your analysis as the former senior advisor to the president under the Trump administration of the current situation in Israel and Gaza? Jared Kushner  (00:04:23) I think you did an excellent job of summarizing a lot of the context, but watching what\\u2019s unfolded over the last 48 hours has been truly heartbreaking to see. We\\u2019re still in the early stages of what\\u2019s developing, but seeing the images on X of militants, terrorists going door to door with machine guns gunning down innocent civilians, seeing beheaded Israeli soldiers, seeing young 20 year olds at a rave, a dance party to celebrate peace with militants flying in and then shooting machine guns to kill people indiscriminately, seeing young children captive and held prisoner, seeing 80-year old grandmothers, a Holocaust survivor also being taken captive. These are just images and actions that we have not seen in this world since 9/11. This is a terror attack on the scale of which we have not seen, and it\\u2019s been incredibly hard for a lot of people to comprehend.  (00:05:33) My heart goes out, obviously, to all of the families of the victims, to the families of those who are held in captive now and to all of Israel because one of the beautiful things about the state of Israel is that when one Israeli is hurting, the entire nation comes together. It\\u2019s a shame that it\\u2019s taking an action like this to unify the nation, but I have seen incredibly beautiful signs over the last 48 hours of a country coming together. The Jewish people have been under oppression before. The Jewish people know what it\\u2019s like, and seeing people rally together to fight for their homeland to try to reestablish safety is a very beautiful thing to watch. I wish it wasn\\u2019t something we had to watch, but it is.  (00:06:26) With that being said though, the backdrop, I\\u2019ve been speaking to friends over the last couple of days. One friend I spoke with last night who was saying that a good friend messaged him saying, I\\u2019m going in. We\\u2019re going to do some operations to try to free some of the hostages held in one of the kibbutzes. Messaged him the next morning. He was one of the first through the door to try to free these hostages, and he was killed by a Hamas militant. Sadly, we\\u2019re going to be hearing many, many more stories of brave Israeli soldiers trying to get these terrorists out of Israel, trying to free innocent civilians who unfortunately are risking their lives to do it. They\\u2019re all heroes, but some will have less good faith than others, sadly.  (00:07:13) It\\u2019s a very, very heartbreaking moment, and I do think that it\\u2019s very important at this moment in time for the entire world to stand behind Israel. I think that Hamas has shown the entire world who they really are. I think what their aim is, what they\\u2019re willing to do, and all of the strong security that Israel\\u2019s put in place over the last years, which in some instances was criticized, I think is now being validated, that there was a real threat that they were looking to deter. Short answer is my heart is broken, praying for peace, praying for strength, praying for Israel to do what it needs to do to avoid being in this situation again, which is either eliminating or severely degrading Hamas\\u2019 capabilities. There cannot be peace in Israel and in the Middle East, while there is a terror group that is being funded by Iran that is allowed to flourish and is allowed to plan operations that are going to aim to kill innocent civilians.  (00:08:20) As somebody who was formerly in this position, who was intimately involved with Israel with the strategies to minimize attacks from Hamas and to try to turn the region around, and I think we did do a very substantial job under President Trump. The Middle East went from one of the most chaotic regions in the world. You had ISIS in 2016, ISIS had a caliphate the size of Ohio. They\\u2019re beheading journalists. They were killing Christians. They controlled 8 million people. They were planning attacks all over the world from their caliphate. They were using the internet to radicalize people. We had the San Bernardino shooting in America. We had the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, and there was real threat. Then you had Iran, which was given $150 billion in a glide path to a nuclear weapon, and they were using their newfound riches to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, different rebels all over the region that were looking to destabilize further. Syria was in a civil war where 500,000 people were killed. Yemen was destabilized, Libya was destabilized, and it was just a mess, and all of America\\u2019s allies had felt betrayed. President Trump came into power. We rebuilt the trust and the relationships with all of our traditional allies. We were able to eliminate ISIS, the territorial caliphate, and then we\\u2019re able to project strength in the region, really go after Iran\\u2019s wallet. We were able to stop through crushing sanctions a lot of their financial resources, which they were using to fund all these terror groups. We left the Middle East with six piece deals and in a fairly peaceful world. Seeing what\\u2019s happening, I think it was completely avoidable. I think it\\u2019s horrible to see that it\\u2019s occurring, and I pray that those in power will make the right decisions to restore safety, but also to potentially create a better paradigm for peace in the future. History of Hamas Lex Fridman  (00:10:29) I have a lot of questions to ask you about the journey towards this historic progress towards peace with Abraham Accords, of course. But first on this situation to step back and some of the history, is there things about the history of Hamas and Gaza that\\u2019s important to understand what is happening now? Just your comments, your thoughts, your understanding of Hamas. Jared Kushner  (00:10:51) I think you did an excellent job, Lex, of really giving the summary. Just a couple of things, maybe I\\u2019ll add to it, is that Hamas was originally founded from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is a group that\\u2019s caused a lot of issues in the region. They\\u2019ve attacked Israel many times in the past. There\\u2019s a lot of discussion about how Israel is an occupying power. Well, in Gaza, in 2005, they withdrew from all the land, and then they say, Israel\\u2019s an apartheid state. Well, Israel then gave governance of the region to the Palestinians, and then what\\u2019s happened is the Palestinian people\\u2019s lives have now gone down, not up since then. I will say that under Hamas\\u2019 leadership in Gaza, the people who have suffered the most are the Palestinian people and I see and I\\u2019ve watched cries throughout my time in government from people saying we want to see the Palestinian people live a better life. I agree with those people. I think that the Palestinian people in Gaza are essentially hostages.  (00:11:52) In Gaza, you have basically 2.2 million people that are being held hostage by 30,000 Hamas terrorists. That\\u2019s really the problem, and I would just encourage people to push their attention and energy in this moment and their anger towards Hamas, those are the people who are killing innocent civilians, who are murdering indiscriminately, and those are the people who have held back the Palestinians from having a better life.  (00:12:23) Finally, what I would say is what we saw with Hamas was that if you go back to 2007, they basically had just one plan that they did over and over. We were very careful to try to monitor very closely and stop the Iranian money and the resources from coming in. Again, we took a little bit of criticism from the international community for keeping the border tight, but unfortunately, every time you\\u2019d allow construction materials to go into Gaza, they\\u2019d use them to build tunnels, not homes. You would have equipment that would come in to build pipes, they\\u2019d turn it into bombs. It was very, very hard to figure out how do you get the resources into Gaza to help people live a better life while at the same time the leadership in Gaza was taking all those resources and turning it into military equipment to attack Israel. Iran Lex Fridman  (00:13:09) What role does Iran play in this war, in this connection to Hamas? Can you speak to the connection between Hamas and Iran that\\u2019s important to understand, especially as this most recent attack unfolds? Jared Kushner  (00:13:22) Sure. The correlation, there\\u2019s reports that Iran is behind the attack. Hamas has thanked Iran for their support, and it\\u2019s been very well known that Iran supports the destruction of the state of Israel. I won\\u2019t say Iran as a country. I\\u2019ll talk about Iran in the leadership. There\\u2019s actually a beautiful thing I saw on the internet where at one of the soccer games in Iran, they were trying to rally support for the Hamas terror attacks and a lot of people in the crowds were chanting FU to the regime because I think the Iranian people, the Persian people generally are peace-loving people who don\\u2019t want to see this focus on destruction and annihilation. But you saw this in 2015, 2016, when the Iranian government had resources, the region was less safe.  (00:14:08) Since now, there\\u2019s been more resources allowed to go to the Iranian regime by lack of enforcement of sanctions. As a result, Iran is funding Hezbollah, Hamas. They were funding the Houthis. Now there\\u2019s a little bit of a d\\xE9tente between Saudi and Iran, which has led to that going down, which only further proves that Iran was behind the Houthis, which is what the Saudis had been saying for years, and Iran was denying. There\\u2019s a very strong relationship between the two, and we always knew that the way that Iran fights wars or fights conflicts is never directly, it\\u2019s usually through its proxies. In this case, Hamas has been a proxy for Iran who wanted to obviously see the destruction of Israel, but also does not want to see the Israelis and the Saudis come together for a peace agreement. Al-Aqsa Mosque Lex Fridman  (00:14:55) The name of this operation, of the Hamas operation is Al-Aqsa Flood, referring to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. How much of this attack is about the Al-Aqsa Mosque? Jared Kushner  (00:15:07) In actuality, I don\\u2019t think any of it is, but the Al-Aqsa Mosque is something that all of the Shia Jihadists have used for years in order to justify their actions that are aggressive towards Israel. This is something, I\\u2019ll maybe even take a step back and go through when I was working initially in my first year on the Peace Plan, I was doing a lot of listening. Quite frankly, a lot of what people were saying to me didn\\u2019t make sense. The reason why I was trying to figure out, they were talking about sovereignty over Al-Aqsa Mosque. The Al-Aqsa Mosque is a mosque that\\u2019s built in the Holy of Holies, the Haram al-Sharif in Israel, where the [Foreign language 00:15:49], the Holy temple was built in a very religious place after the Temple was destroyed. Then there was a big mosque built there, and it\\u2019s one of the more holy places in Islam now.  (00:16:03) The big thing everyone was saying is, \\u201CWhat do you do with this land where you have a mosque built over a very big Jewish site?\\u201D I was hearing all of the experts, and I always say experts with quotes, because only in Washington can you work on something for a decade and continue to fail, and then you basically leave are considered an expert. But that\\u2019s one of the problems with Washington, which maybe we could talk about later. But the notion here was I went and I said, \\u201CLet me try to understand what the issue is with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the people.\\u201D I always felt the politicians were a little disconnected so I commissioned several focus groups, one in Amman, one in Cairo, one in Dubai, and one in Ramallah. I asked people, Muslims, what is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? Time and time again, the most popular thing that they said was that Israel was not allowing access to the mosque for Muslims to pray. What was interesting was is that Israel\\u2019s policy is to allow anyone who wants to come and pray peacefully at the sites to come and pray. Sometimes they have security issues when there\\u2019s provocations. But by and large, since 1967, when Israel was able to take back Jerusalem in a defensive war, just to be very clear, they were attacked in the South and they were attacked from the east, and they basically were able to beat back the Jordanians and the Egyptians and then reconquer the old city of Jerusalem. During that time, immediately after Israel then passed the protection of Holy Places law, which was they basically took resources they didn\\u2019t have and they said we\\u2019re going to restore the Christian sites, the Muslim sites, the Jewish sites, and they\\u2019ve worked to allow everyone access to the mosque.\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n",

They have different address space.  OS offers inter process communication. There are different ways of doing so. First we see how to spawn new processes and then how to communicate.  ### Forking  `fork()` spawns a new child process which is a copy of itself. The child program will be exactly the same and will start from the instruction following the fork, except for the return value of the `fork()`:  - 0 in the child process - child PID in the parent process  The two processes will have a different address space, the memory is not actually copied until one of the two processes writes on it (copy-on-write) for efficiency.  We have no control over which one of the two processes will execute first a certain part, they are concurrent.  Each process has:  - exactly one parent process - zero or more child processes - PID: Process IDentifier   - `pid_t`, currently 32 bit integer   - limited by `/proc/sys/pid_max` - PPID: Parent PID  ### Executing  Load a new program and replace the current process image with it.  It uses the `execve` syscall, C offers several interfaces to do this with some slight variations: `exec,execlp,execle,execv,execvp,execve`.  structure is exec + options  - `-l` accepts list of parameters, NULL terminated - `-v` accepts array of NULL terminated strings - `-p` search the PATH environment variable - `-e` allows to specify new environment variables  ### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)  We will follow the POSIX standard (no SystemV):  - newer - IEEE 1003.1-2017 follow posix standard - thread-safe  We will see the following POSIX components:  - signals - pipes (also called unnamed pipes) - FIFO (also called named pipes) - message queues - shared memory - semaphores  #### Signals  - unidirectional - no data transfer, contain only the signal type - asynchronous  Used to signal some event (I/O operation done, exceptions, ...):  - SIGCHLD, child sends to parent when it terminates - SIGILL, sent to a process by the OS if it tries to executes an illegal instruction - many others  Most signals by default cause the termination of the process, but the behaviour can be overridden with a custom signal handler.  Sending signal:  ```C #include \\u003Csignal.h> #include \\u003Csys/types.h> int kill(pid_t pid, int sig); // pid: pid of the receiving program // sig: the signal to send // returns 0 on success -1 on fail ```  Handling signal:  ```C #include \\u003Csignal.h> int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act, struct sigaction *oldact); // signum: the signal to handle // act: handler to call when receiving the signal // oldact: saves old handler (can be NULL) // returns 0 on success -1 on fail ```  The `act` structure contains all the info on handling the signal:  ```C struct sigaction { void (*sa_handler)(int); void (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *); sigset_t sa_mask; int sa_flags; void (*sa_restorer)(void); }; ```  - `sa_handler`: function to handle the signal (or `SIG_IGN` to ignore it) - `sa_sigaction`: alternative handler that accepts input data - `sa_mask`: set a mask to block certain signals (not all signals can be blocked or ignored)* - `sa_flags`: various options, see docs - `sa_restore`: not in POSIX, not for user use, don't use  *masked signals are queued for later processing (SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be masked)  #### Pipes  Based on the producer/consumer pattern, they are unidirecitonal queues where data is written/read FIFO.  In Linux, the OS guarantees that only one process at a time can access the pipe.  Creating a pipe  ```C #include \\u003Cunistd.h> #include \\u003Cfcntl.h>  int pipe(int pipefd[2]); int pipe2(int pipefd[2], int flags); ```  `pipefd` will be filled with two file descriptors:  - `pipefd[0]` the read end of the pipe - `pipefd[1]` the write end of the pipe  `flags` can be various options (e.g. non blocking if full/empty)  To use a pipe one can directly do r/w operations on them with low level `read` and `write` or open them as a stream (like a file).  #### FIFO  Similar to pipes, they are based on special files in the filesystem, but no actual I/O is done, the OS passes the data. (It sorts of pretend that it is a file, usually under `/tmp/something`).  Creating a FIFO  ```C #include \\u003Csys/types.h> #include \\u003Csys/stat.h>  int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode); ```  #### Message queues  Suitable for multiple writers and readers, based on a priority queue. Can be accessed via special files in the `/dev/mqueue/` directory (requires POSIX real-time extension library).  Creating a message queue  ```C #include \\u003Cmqueue.h> mqd_t mq_open(const char *name, int oflag, mode_t mode, struct mq_attr *attr); ```  - `name`: a unique name for the message queue, starting with `/` - `oflag`: opening flag O_RDONLY, etc - `mode`: the permissions of the file - `attrs`: attributes (see struct)    ```C   struct mq_attr {   long mq_flags; // 0 or NON_BLOCK   long mq_maxmsg; // max nr. messages in the queue   long mq_msgsize; // max message size in bytes   long mq_curmsgs; // nr. messages currently in the queue   };   ```  A process can use the queue using these functions (args are self explainatory, priority is 0-31, same priority messages follow FIFO logic):  ```C #include \\u003Cmqueue.h> int mq_send(mqd_t mqdes, const char *msg_ptr, size_t msg_len, unsigned int msg_prio);  int mq_receive(mqd_t mqdes, char *msg_ptr, size_t msg_len, unsigned int *msg_prio); ```  #### Shared memory  Allow processes to share a memory segment, based on the *memory mapping* concept (require POSIX real-time extension library).  NOTE: shared memory access needs to be properly sinchronized, see later.  To use shared memory:  - create a shared memory area (args are the same as mqueue, returns a file descriptor)      ```C   #include \\u003Csys/mman.h>   #include \\u003Csys/stat.h>   #include \\u003Csys/fcntl.h>      int shm_open(const char *name, int oflag, mode_t mode);   ```  - specify the size of the special object with `fd_truncate` - `mmap` the fd to an area of the memory of the process  When the process is done, some cleanup is needed:  ```C #include \\u003Csys/mman.h>  // delete the mapping in the process memory int munmap(void *addr, size_t length);  // removes shared memory object created with the open int shm_unlink(const char *name); ```  ### Synchronization  The simplest mechanism is the `wait()` (and `waitpid(pid_t pid)`) primitive:  - wait:  suspends the execution until one child completes - waitpid:  suspends execution until that specific child completes  Signatures:  ```C pid_t wait(int *status); pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options); ```  `status` is used to collect the return value from the child process (can be NULL if i don't care).  #### Zombie processes  If the parent process does't call `wait` before exiting, the child processes will become zombies (they are ended but are waiting to return the exit value) and consume resources.  All orphan children are adopted by init that calls wait and frees memory and PID number.  Zombie processes are a sign of bad programming.  #### Semaphores  The approach based on `wait` is very limited. POSIX provides inter-process semaphores. The general logic is simple:  - semaphore counter == 0 ---> WAIT - semaphore counter > 0 ---> proceed   - if counter can only be 0 or 1 then it's a binary semaphore  There are 2 atomic functions to interact with the semaphore:  - `wait()` blocks until counter becomes > 0, then decrements it and proceed - `post()` increments counter  Similarly to pipes, they can be named or unnamed. `pthread` library is required to use those.  ```C #include \\u003Csemaphore.h>  // unnamed semaphores // create int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value); // destroy int sem_destroy(sem_t *sem);  // named semaphores // create sem_t * sem_open(const char *name, int oflags); sem_t * sem_open(const char *name, int oflags, mode_t mode, unsigned int value); // destroy int sem_close(sem_t *sem); int sem_unlink(const char *name);  // interacting with the semaphore int sem_wait(sem_t *sem); int sem_trywait(sem_t *sem);  // non blocking alternative int sem_timedwait(sem_t *sem, const struct timespec *timeout);  int sem_post(sem_t *sem); ```  All functions return 0 on success and -1 on error.  #### Final notes  Choosing which IPC method do use is not trivial and can impact performance. The best choice depends on several variables:  - data size and type - machine architecture - system workload - ...  See [this link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/projects/ipc-bench/) for a study on IPC performance.  ## Task scheduling  Scheduler: OS component responsible for establishing the order of execution of the tasks. The ordering algorithm is called scheduling policy.  Idea:  - tasks are preeempted by the OS in order to dispatch another task   - can also be task triggered (unusual)   - the OS also dispatches another task when the current one is blocked waiting for I/O operations - preemption is performed via context switch: save current registers and load back another task  Tasks can be in different states:  ![task_state_diagram](assets/task_state_diagram.png)  - new: task just created - ready: task can be dispatched at any time - running: currently using the CPU - blocked: waiting on an I/O request - terminated: the task has exited  In reality there are much more states defined in the Linux kernel, but those are the major ones.  ### Task model  ![task_model](assets/task_model.png)  - `a_i` arrival time, when the tasks is ready to be scheduled - `s_i` start time, starts execution - `W_i` wait time, time spent waiting in the queue `W_i = s_i - a_i`   - NOTE: many times in the exercises this is the total wait (initial delay + other waits due to preemptions) - `f_i` finishing time, when the execution terminates - `C_i` computation time (or burst time), time necessary for the processor to execute the task (without interruptions) - `Z_i` turnaround time, total time taken from when the task is ready to when it completes `Z_i = f_i - a_i` (NOTE: not the same as `W_i + C_i` because there can be interruptions (well, it is ``W_i + C_i` if `W_i` is the total wait))  Based on the operations done by the task we distinguish between:  - CPU-bound   - spends most of the time executing stuff   - `Z_i ~ W_i + C_i` - I/O bound   - spends most of the time waiting for I/O operation   - `Z_i >> W_i + C_i`  ### Platform model  A computing system is composed of:  - `m` processing elements (PE) CPU   - to each CPU, at each time `t`, it is assigned zero or one task - `s` additional resources R   - each resource, at each time `t` is assigned to zero or more tasks  ### Problem statement  Given  - a set of `n` tasks - a set of `m` PE - a set of resources `R`  Compute an optimal schedule and resource allocation (NP-complete problem).  This is very difficult: what does optimal mean? There can be different objectives that require different policies to be in place in order to achieve them:  - maximize processor utilization - maximize throughput: number of tasks completing per time unit - minimize waiting time: time spent ready in the wait queue - ensure fairness - minimize scheduling overhead - minimize turnaround time - and many more: energy, power, temps, ....  These objective are generally in contrast with each other, we need to find a good balance.  #### Starvation  Undesirable condition in which one or more task cannot execute due to lack of resources (e.g. low priority task that always get pushed back in favor of higher priority tasks).  ### Scheduling algorithms classification  - preemptive vs not preemptive   - preemptive schedulers, can interrupt tasks to allocate CPU to another task, required for responsive systems   - not preemptive, a task when it's scheduled runs until completion. Has minimum overhead but bad for responsiveness - static vs dynamic   - static, scheduler decisions are based on fixed parameters known before task activation (not very realistic in general purpose systems)   - dynamic, scheduler decisions are based on parameters that change at run time and new tasks can be added - offline vs online   - offline, run once before activation, when the schedule is decided it doesn't change   - online, executed at run time during task execution, new tasks can be added - optimal vs heuristic   - optimal can give some guarantees but usually has much higher overhead   - heuristic has no guarantees but in practice it can be almost as good with much lower overhead  ### Scheduling algorithms  Simple algorithms that target systems with only one processor. #### First-In-First-Out (FIFO)  First-In-First-Out (FIFO) scheduler:  - tasks scheduled in order of arrival - non preemptive  The advantage is that it is very simple to implement and doesn't need to know anything about processes but it is not good for responsive systems (long tasks monopolize the CPU, short tasks are penalized).  ![FIFO_scheduler](assets/FIFO_scheduler.png)  #### Shortest Job First (SJF)  Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduler:   - tasks scheduled in ascending order of computation time `C_i` - non preemptive  It is the optimal non preemptive scheduler w.r.t. minimizing waiting time, but there is the risk of starving long tasks. Moreover, we need to know the time required to complete ahead of time.  ![SJF_scheduler](assets/SJF_scheduler.png)  #### Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)  Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) scheduler:  - preemptive variant of SJF - it uses the remaining execution time instead of the total to schedule next task  It is more responsive than SJF but shares the same disadvantages.  ![STRF_scheduler](assets/STRF_scheduler.png)  The preemption occurs when a new task arrives but only if the new task has a shorter remaining time than the current task, otherwise the current task continues.  #### Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)  Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) scheduler:  - select task with the highest response ratio, computed as:   - `RR_i = (W_i + C_i) / C_i` - not preemptive  It prevents starvation of longer tasks w.r.t. SJF but again, we need to know `C_i` in advance.  ![HRRN_scheduling](assets/HRRN_scheduling.png)  #### Round Robin (RR)  Round Robin (RR) scheduler:  - task are scheduled to run for a given amount of time `q` (quantum or time slice) - preemptive  This approach has several advantages:  - computable maximum waiting time `(n - 1) * q` - no need to know `C_i` in advance - good to achieve fairness and responsiveness goals - no starvation  However, it has a worse turnaround than SJF.  ![RR_scheduler](assets/RR_scheduler.png)  Preemption occurs at the end of the time quantum that the task has allocated (or before if the tasks ends). The preempted task is put back at the end of the queue. New tasks are added to the ready queue in a FIFO fashion.  NOTE: if a task is preempted at the same time a new one arrives the order of operation is:  - add new tasks at the end of the queue - preempt the current task and put at the end of queue  The value of the quantum of time is very important:  - long quantum:   - tend to FIFO scheduler   - favors CPU-bound tasks   - low overhead (less context switches) - short quantum:   - reduce average waiting time   - favors I/O-bound tasks   - good for responsiveness and fair scheduling   - higher overhead (more context switches have to occur)  In Linux the default time quantum for RR scheduler is stored in `/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms` (default 100ms).  ### Priority-based scheduling and multi-level scheduling  Can assign a priority to each task to specify its importance. Can be fixed at design time or change dynamically at run time. It is usually expressed using an integer value, the lower the value the higher the priority.  In a priority-based scheduler usually there are multiple ready queues, divided by priority. The first task to schedule is picked from the topmost non-empty queue. Tasks can be preempted if a higher priority task arrives.  ![priority-based_scheduling](assets/priority-based_scheduling.png)  For each of these queues i can use a different scheduling algorithm.   Of course this approach could cause starvation of tasks with lower priority, so we need to use correctly the scheduling algorithms at the different queues.  Example:   use RR for each queue, but use a longer quantum for lower priority tasks to compensate for the long wait. Then we can assign lower priority to CPU-bound tasks (so they get a longer time slice) and high priority for I/O bound tasks (increase responsiveness).  How can we determine if a task is CPU-bound?  - information provided by the user - use some feedback mechanism in the scheduler using a dynamic priority (Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduling)   - new tasks are put in the highest priority queue   - if the tasks uses the whole quantum, then when it's preempted move it to a lower priority queue     - the idea is that CPU-bound tasks will use more CPU, so they will be moved to queues with longer quantums, while I/O-bound tasks, since they will block before finishing the quantum, will remain in high priority  This doesn't solve the problem of starvation. To do so we need to do time slicing between all the queues, for instance:  - i have a 100ms time window - 80ms assigned to first queue (high priority) - 15ms assigned to intermediate priority - 5ms assigned to lower priority  This way i can guarantee that all queues get at least a certain percentage of CPU time.  Another option to prevent starvation is the concept of *aging*: the more a task spends time in the ready queue the more its priority is increased. This prevents it from being postponed indefinitely by the arrival of newer tasks.  ### Multi-processor scheduling  This problem is way harder, the scheduler also has to choose which CPU to assign the task to:  - task synchronization may occur across parallel executions - it's difficult to achieve high utilization of all CPU cores   - need to migrate tasks across cores to balance the load, but this leads to cache miss penalties (the data needs to be loaded in the cache of the new core) - simultaneous access to shared resources (e.g. cache memory)   - task scheduled on the same core may trash each other data from the cache (i.e. they need two resources that maps on the same cache address) slowing each other down, it would be more efficient to schedule those on different cores   - they could still interfere on higher level caches that are shared across cores...  There could be different design choices for the scheduler:  - single queues vs multiple queues   - single queue:     - all tasks wait in a global queue     - simple design     - good fairness     - good for managing CPU utilization     - issues with scalability, the scheduler runs in any core and require synchronized access to the ready queue (semaphore/mutexes)   - multiple queues:     - ready queue for each processor     - more scalable     - easier to exploit data locality in caches     - can use one global scheduler or a per-CPU scheduler     - potentially more overhead (more data structures to manage)     - needs load balancing --> rebalance queues if necessary to achieve good utilization and reduce waiting time (i.e. move waiting tasks to idling or less loaded cores)       - also useful to manage thermals (spread load across cores to avoid hot spots)       - this has also impact on power consumption and reliability       - task migration may happen in two ways:         - push model: a dedicated task periodically checks each queue and rebalances if necessary         - pull model: a processor may notify an empty queue and pick tasks from other queues - single scheduler vs multiple per-processor scheduler - can also use a hierchical queue: global queue that dispatches tasks to the queue of each CPU:   - better utilization and load balancing   - good scalability   - more complex to implement  ## Concurrency  Concurrency is when a program is composed by activities where one activity can start before the previous one has finished. This is what we will see:  - thread execution model   - need context switching to save state between threads   - hw parallelism (multicore)   - sw parallelism (timesharing) - lightweight execution model   - do not require context switches, supported by programming languages   - coroutines   - generators   - event-based models     - continuation passing (callbacks)     - async/await constructs  Why use concurrency if it is harder? Because we are reaching the limits of single core improvements.  ![microprocessor_evolution](assets/microprocessor_evolution.png)  ### Properties and issues  We characterize concurrent programs with two properties:  - safety (correctness): never reach error states. Possible issues are:   - data race: program behaviour depends in an uncontrolled way from the memory model and the interleaving of threads. If it is not what the programmer wants it is a bug.   - atomicity violation: operations supposed to be atomic in reality they are not and can lead to problems   ```C     // Thread 1::   if (thd->proc_info) {       // proc_info can become NULL after the check if interleaves with thread 2       fputs(thd->proc_info, ...);   }   ...   // Thread 2::   thd->proc_info = NULL;   ```   - order violation: assume a specific order of execution when there is no guarantee that it will be that way - liveness (progress): eventually all activities will be able to finish. Issues that concern liveness are:   - deadlocks: no task can take action because it is waiting for another task to take action (e.g. t1 waits for t2 and t2 waits for t1)     - mutual exclusion, only one can access a specific resource       - preventable if there are some atomic instructions to read and act on the data (needs to be supported by CPU)     - hold-and-wait, threads hold some resource and wait for the release of another       - preventable by using appropriate API to release a resource if the acquisition of further resources fails       ```C       lock(M1);  // blocks until the lock is obtained       if(!try_lock(M2)) {  // doesn't block, if resource not available it returns           release(M1);  // if i cannot get M2, release the first resource       }       else {           update(R1);  // when i get them both, use them           update(R2);           release(M1,M2);  // and release those in the end       }       ```     - no preemption, resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread that is holding them     - circular wait, at the end this is the cause of all deadlocks       - need to ensure a certain order in the locking of the resources (or exclude unwanted orders)   - priority inversion: this causes higher priority tasks to be delayed because they need to wait for a lower priority task to release a lock on a resource. This doesn't cause deadlocks but dealys a high priority task and can lead to missing some deadline (see [1997 pathfinder mission](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hatcliff/842/Docs/Course-Overview/pathfinder-robotmag.pdf)). This can be solved in different ways:     - highest locker priority protocol: raise the priority of a task holding a lock to the highest priority task that holds that resource.     - priority inheritance protocol: similar as before but the lower priority task gets his priority increased only when the high priority task tries to enter the critical section.     - priority ceiling protocol: a priority ceiling for a semaphore is the highest priority among the tasks that could lock it. In this context a task is allowed to enter a critical section only if its priority is higher than all the priority ceilings of the resources currently locked by other tasks that it has to access.  ### Linux user space concurrency  Based on the concept of *futex* (fast user-level lock) and has the following objectives:  - avoid unnecessary system calls (they are expensive) - avoid unnecessary context switches - avoid thundering herd problem (wake up multiple threads but only one can run)  ![futex_vs_traditional_lock](assets/futex_vs_traditional_lock.png)  futex allow uncontended locks (i.e. only one thread is trying to use the resource) to be locked/unlocked without switching to kernel mode. If a thread is holding the lock and another thread tries to lock it (contended) it is necessary to have the kernel intervene and put the thread in a wait queue. If uncontended access is frequent this approach allows to avoid lots of system calls.  For this to work the lock needs to stay in the runtime instead of the kernel, it is usually implemented as a 32 bit integer managed with **atomic** instructions:  - 31 bits encode the number of waiters - 1 bit flags the state (lock/unlocked), it is the MSB   - check if set     - not set --> set the bit     - set --> syscall to put the thread in waiting, call `futex` with `FUTEX_WAIT` flag   - remember that the check and set is done in an atomic operation (depends on the platform)  This functionality is implemented like this:  ```C void futex_based_lock(int *mutex) {   int v;   if (atomic_bit_test_set(mutex, 31) == 0)        return;   atomic_increment(mutex);   while (1) {       if (atomic_bit_test_set(mutex, 31) == 0) {           atomic_decrement(mutex);           return;       }       v = *mutex;       // technicality, if 32th bit is set the number is negative       // i want to call the syscall only if i'm sure that the bit is set       // v > 0 --> unlocked        // v \\u003C 0 --> locked       if (v >= 0)            continue;       futex(mutex, FUTEX_WAIT, v); /* sleeps only if mutex still has v */   } }  void futex_based_unlock(int *mutex) {   // unlock and if the mutex is zero return   // the add is basically adding 1 to the 32 bit   // if the result is zero it means that   // - 32th bit is 0 --> unlocked   // - other bits are 0 --> no more waiters   // so it wakes up a thread only if there is something waiting   if (atomic_add_zero(mutex, 0x80000000))       return;   futex(mutex, FUTEX_WAKE, 1); // wake up only one thread } ```  NOTE: futexes are also used to implement condition variables and try to avoid thundering herd problem.  #### Event-based concurrency  DIfferent style of concurrent programming. Multiple activity whose progress is triggered by external events. Locks in these cases are not the optimal way to go about it.  The classical example is some GUI-based program waiting for user interaction or internet based services.  The general idea is: - wait for some event to occur - check what type of event arrived and identify which activity it belongs to - do the small amount of work it requires (I/O requests, other events, ...) - repeat  We want to avoid the cost of context switches if not necessary. To implement this we use an *event loop*: a single thread that blocks on all events and calls other activities as functions... sort of, because they need to restore the state that the activity had before. This is done using callbacks (continuation passing style).  The advantages of this approach is that: - when a handler processes an event, it is the only activity taking place in the system (in the event loop thread)   - no locking needed   - no context switch needed - network I/O via the `select` or `poll` API - ability to run blocking I/O in a separate thread pool and register a callback when to call when the data is ready (avoid blocking entire app). `libuv` offers an interface to do so.  Limits of event loops --> it runs in a single thread, it is difficult to extend to multicore.   ### Linux kernel space concurrency  There are multiple sources of concurrency in the kernel:  - interrupts - multiple processors - kernel preemption: multiple threads in the kernel can share the same resources  #### Interrupts  An interrupts can occur asynchronously almost at any time, interrupting the code currently executing in kernel mode. If the interrupt and the interrupted task need to use the same resource then access must be regulated.  Code that is safe from concurrenct access from interrupt handler is said to be interrupt-safe (example the global variable `jiffies` that keeps track of the uptime).  #### Multiprocessors  Kernel code must be able to simultaneously run on multiple processors, therefore there is the need to regulate access to resources that are shared (true concurrency).  Code that is safe from true concurrency on symmetrical multiprocessor machines is said to be SMP-safe.  Do all processor see the memory in the same way?  #### Kernel preemption  ![preemptive_kernel](assets/preemptive_kernel.png)  Scheduling can be called during some kernel mode code execution and switch to another activity that is deemed more important. This allows for increased responsiveness.   From 2.6, the Linux kernel became preemptable and the preemption points are:  - end of an interrupt handling, when `TIF_NEED_RESCHED` flag is set in the thread (forced context switch) - if a task in the kernel explicitly blocks, which causes `schedule()` to be called (planned context switch)  How can we ensure that a context switch occurs only if it is safe to do so?  A variable is used, called `preempt_count`, that keeps track of the preemptions:  - set at 0 when the process enters kernel mode - increase by 1 on lock acquisition (critical section) - increase by 1 on interrupt  ![preemption_count](assets/preemption_count.png)  As long as `preempt_count > 0` the kernel cannot switch.  NOTES:  - can compile kernel to avoid preemption - can also do the opposite, increase the responsiveness of the kernel to be suitable for more \\\"real-time\\\" operations:   - apply the `PREEMPT_RT` patch that tries to maximize the preemptability of the kernel     - preempt critical sections in the kernel     - manage interrupt in their own separate thread  ### Kernel synchronization  #### Spinlocks  Locking operation doesn't put to sleep the activity that is trying to lock, it's a busy wait. The thread keeps \\\"spinning\\\" on the lock variable until it can get the lock. It requires platform support to do the atomic operations on the locking variable.  For instance in [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock)  ```asm ; Intel syntax  locked:                      ; The lock variable. 1 = locked, 0 = unlocked.      dd      0  spin_lock:      mov     eax, 1          ; Set the EAX register to 1.      xchg    eax, [locked]   ; Atomically swap the EAX register with                              ;  the lock variable.                              ; This will always store 1 to the lock, leaving                              ;  the previous value in the EAX register.      test    eax, eax        ; Test EAX with itself. Among other things, this will                              ;  set the processor's Zero Flag if EAX is 0.                              ; If EAX is 0, then the lock was unlocked and                              ;  we just locked it.                              ; Otherwise, EAX is 1 and we didn't acquire the lock.      jnz     spin_lock       ; Jump back to the MOV instruction if the Zero Flag is                              ;  not set; the lock was previously locked, and so                              ; we need to spin until it becomes unlocked.      ret                     ; The lock has been acquired, return to the calling                              ;  function.  spin_unlock:      xor     eax, eax        ; Set the EAX register to 0.      xchg    eax, [locked]   ; Atomically swap the EAX register with                              ;  the lock variable.      ret                     ; The lock has been released. ```  Of course if the wait is long the spinlock becomes a wasteful way of locking since the thread keeps the CPU without doing anything except waiting. On uniprocessor machines this is just a call to `preempt_disable()`, only on multiprocessor system the thread actually spins.  Variants:  - Readwrite locks    Distinguish between readers and writers, multiple readers can access the object but only a writer at a time is allowed.    This is used to maximize concurrent access when there is no risk of concurrent modification.    ```C   // create the lock   DEFINE_RWLOCK(mr_rwlock);   // reader   read_lock(&mr_rwlock);   // critical section (read only), concurrent reads allowed   read_unlock(&mr_rwlock);    // writer   write_lock(&mr_rwlock);   // critical section (read and write), only holder of the lock   write_unlock(&mr_lock);   ```  - Seqlocks    Similar to readwrite locks but want to prevent the starvation of writers. The idea is:    - when writer acquire lock it increments a counter (starting from 0)   - when it releases it, the counter is incremented again    This means that if the counter is even there are no writes going on, while if it is odd a write is currently holding the lock.    Readers check the counter when trying to lock:   - odd: busy wait   - even: return counter     - do work but before releasing check if the counter changed, if it did redo the work      ```C   // what the write does   write_seqlock(&mr_seq_lock); // increment seq. counter   // write lock is obtained...   write_sequnlock(&mr_seq_lock); // increment seq. counter      // what the read does   do {       // loops if seq. counter odd       seq = read_seqbegin(&mr_seq_lock);          // ^       // read/copy data here ...              | check if seq. counter equal.   } while (read_seqretry(&mr_seq_lock, seq)); // V   ```    Example, the `jiffies` variable is frequently read by interrupt handler. For machines that do not have atomic 64 bit reads, it is read using a seqlock.  #### Sleeping locks  Tasks trying to lock an already locked resource are put to sleep. Implemented with a semaphore. Better choice if the time that we have to wait is unknown or expected to be long.  MEMO: semaphore, basically a counter, lock decrements, unlock increments, blocked when trying to lock a 0 semaphore.  ```C // define and declare a semaphore, named mr_sem, with a count of one static DECLARE_MUTEX(mr_sem); // attempt to acquire the semaphore (can also specify interruptible) if (down_interruptible(&mr_sem)) {   // signal received, semaphore not acquired } // critical region // release the given semaphore up(&mr_sem); ```  #### Read copy update locks (RCU)  The goal is to have low latency reads to shared data that is read often but updated infrequently. The idea works as follow and it's an improvement over seqlocks:  - readers   - avoid locks   - should tolerate concurrent writers   - might see old version of the data for a short time - writers   - create a new copy of the data structure   - publish new version with a single atomic operation  Basically the idea is that writers update the data \\\"offline\\\" and then commit the changes atomically when they are done. The reader can read old data while the writer is modifying the data but has not committed yet.  Of course, the writer needs to wait some *grace period* to allow all readers of the old structure to finish their work on the old struct before deallocating it.  ![read_copy_update_locks](assets/read_copy_update_locks.png)  So to recap:  - avoid deadlocks - read locks acquisition are easy (they don't lock at all) - writer might delay the completion of destructive operations  #### Locks and multiprocessing  In a SMP system, an attempt to acquire a lock requires moving the cache line containing that lock to the local CPU cache.  If another CPU tries to check the lock it forces the value held in the cache of the first CPU to be written back to memory (to ensure consistency). If multiple processors are spinning on the same lock there is a overhead because of the need to ensure memory consistency.  Mellor-Crummey and Scott lock (MCS or `queued spinlocks`) are a way to better implement spinlocks on multicore systems to avoid this overhead.  ![MCS_lock](assets/MCS_lock.png)  The idea is:  - start with a spinlock that is not taken - P1 comes and takes the lock   - when the lock is taken, it allocates a processor specific data structure (each processor has it's own version of that data structure)   - the lock points to that specific data structure - if P3 arrives an tries to take the lock   -  gets it's own copy of the struct   - the P1 struct will point to P3 as `next locker` - this way we have several advantages   - each CPU spins on its own lock variable   - when one CPU releases the lock it notifies the next one in line   - no coherency needs to be enforced because each CPU is on a different variable and, on release, they are given the lock in order  ### Memory models  Defines the behaviour and the consistency of how operations done by one thread are seen by the other threads in a multiprocessor system. Due to write buffering, speculative execution and cache coherency the order of access of the memory may not be seen in the same way by another thread. This depends on the way the architecture manages memory, for instance:  ```C // thread 1 x = 1; done = 1;  // thread 2 while(done == 0) { /* loop */ } print(x); ``` On an x86 machine it will always print `1` while on an ARM processor it can also print `0`.  We can distinguish 2 types of ordering:  - program order: order in which a thread does the memory accesses, denoted by `\\u003C_p` (happens before in program order) - memory order: order in which the operation are seen by the shared memory, denoted by `\\u003C_m` (happens before in memory order)  We will cover 3 models:  - sequential: strongest possible and more difficult to achieve, does not exist in practice   - if `i \\u003C_p j` then `i \\u003C_m j`, operations of each processor appear in the same order specified by the program that is running. - total store order (TSO): model of x86    ![total_store_order](assets/total_store_order.png)      - each thread interfaces with the shared memory through a FIFO store buffer, so writes can be seen \\\"delayed\\\"     - if the thread wants to read data that is still in the store buffer then it will read it from there --> the processor sees the data that it has written, even if other threads have not yet seen it     - otherwise the data is pulled from the shared memory     - all other threads see the write at the same time when it is written back to the shared memory   - there is a `mfence` instruction that forces the flush of the write buffer. There are also `.L` (locked) instructions that require to get a global lock on the resource before executing (unlocking flushes the write buffer)   - reads may be issued before writes due to speculation - partial store order (PSO): model of ARM, much weaker model    ![partial_store_order](assets/partial_store_order.png)    - each processor reads and writes as if it had its own complete copy of the memory     - writes can be reordered by out-of-order execution in the same processor     - no mechanism to ensure that all other processors see the writes at the same time and in the same ordering  #### Data races  The PSO model can allow something like this to happen  ![data_race_in_PSO](assets/data_race_in_PSO.png)  Because there is no enforcement of an happens-before relation. We need to use some synchronization instructions. Not quite the same thing as a memory barrier, we just enforce that after a specific write, all the writes that happened before have been committed to the shared memory (note: doesn't mean that all the previous writes are committed in order, like TSO, just that they have been committed). That specific write is called a *release* and to exploit it when reading it is needed to do an *acquire* operation.  This eliminates the data race.  If all data races can be removed then the program will appear as if it was sequentially consistent.  #### Software memory models  Compilers can introduce additional reordering of instructions that might appear as if the machine had a weaker memory model. Higher level languages must give programmers the ability to enforce some happen-before relationships. This is called language memory model.  If you write a data race free program then it will behave like a sequentially consistent one.  (see slides for C++ memory model)  ##### Linux Kernel Memory Model (LKMM)  The model is essentially the lowest common denominator of the guarantees of all the CPU families where the kernel can run.  - happens-before relationships can be enforced using `smp_store_release` and `smp_load_acquire` - provides `atomic_t` and `atomic64_t`. Operations on this types are guaranteed to be non interruptible.      ```C   atomic_t v = ATOMIC_INIT(0);   atomic_set(&v, 4);   atomic_add(2, &v);   atomic_inc(&v);   ``` ## Virtual memory  Linux (as any other modern OS) uses virtual memory.  Virtual pages are mapped to physical pages, each process has a memory structure `mm_struct` that is used by the kernel to keep track of the mapping.  Each task has it's own value for the register that points to the base of the page directory (`RC3` in x86).  Both kernel and user space code use virtual memory:  - higher memory addresses for the kernel - lower memory addresses for user space programs  How it this managed?  - `KERNEL VIRTUAL` used for remapping some pages (e.g. pages that need to be contiguous in the virtual space but not necessarily in the physical). Allocated by `vmalloc`. - `KERNEL LOGICAL` direct image of all the physical memory (offsetted by some address in order to live in the kernel memory area). Contiguous pages are also contiguous in the physical memory. Allocated by `kalloc`. Typically used for DMA.  Virtual pages can be mapped:  - directly to physical memory pages - not mapped to physical (e.g. swapped out to disk)   - used to manage data that doesn't fit in memory - neither of those, for instance pages allocated via `brk` to expand some area that are not mapped until they are used  A user mode process memory is composed of many Virtual Memory Areas (VMAs) and they are stored in the `mm_struct` of the process and can be inspected in the `/proc/\\u003Cpid>/maps` file.  ![process_VMA](assets/process_VMA.png)  A VMA can be:  - anonymous: exists only in memory, not corresponding to a file (until they need to be swapped) - file_backed (backing store): there is a corresponding file on disk, for instance the code for a program, a library, ...  Also there are flags to specify what action can be done on them (read/write/exec/...).  Multiple VMAs can point to the same physical pages to share resources (for instance library code).  ### Page fault management  What happens when a process tries to access a page that is not present in memory? The page table contains only the pages that are present in memory, but the process can have more pages that are not present, managed in the VMAs. There are 2 possibilities:  - page valid but it's not mapped   - if so it needs to be loaded - page is invalid   - segmentation fault  To add pages to the VMA a process needs to call `brk()` (but pages are actually allocated only on access --> demand paging)  ![page_fault_management](assets/page_fault_management.png)  The `find_vma` function uses a RB-tree to find the corresponding VMA (uses tree instead of list for efficiency).  - not found: `SIGSEGV` - found:   - check permissions     - `SIGSEGV` if doesn't have permission (e.g. write to a read only area)   - `handle_mm_fault` allocates a page table entry if needed   - `handle_pte_fault` load from disk  New VMAs can be created by a process by calling `mmap()` on already open file descriptors. This allows to avoid copy of files in the space of the each process and share access to a *file cache* of already opened files.  ### Physical address space  #### NUMA  Physical memory can be in different NUMA nodes (e.g. on multiprocessor systems). Linux keeps a data structure `pg_data_t` for each node in a list (If a single NUMA node is present there is only one element).   ![NUMA_nodes](assets/NUMA_nodes.png)  For each node there is several information stored:  - the memory of each node id divided in 3 zones:   - `ZONE_DMA`: what zones can be used for DMA by other devices   - `ZONE_NORMAL`:    - `ZONE_HIGHMEMORY`: not considered here    Each zone has      - `free_area` structure that keeps track of the areas that are free, grouped by the number of contiguous pages available     - `watermarks` 3 possible values (high, low, min), stating how many pages are free.       ![memory_zones_watermarks](assets/memory_zones_watermarks.png)        - above `high`, pages are consumed by the buddy allocator       - between `high` and `low`, the allocator wakes up the `kswapd` to start freeing up pages       - between `low` and `min`, the allocator will swap pages itself       - below `min`, normally not allowed, only in specific cases - `node_mem_map` stores all the available memory pages in that node - `lruvec` keeps track of the activity of each pages, used to decide which pages to swap in case of necessity  #### Buddy allocator  The idea is:  - do not fragment contiguous blocks of pages too much - compact free large blocks with little overhead  To allocate the blocks it works like this:  ![buddy_allocator](assets/buddy_allocator.png)  - recursively split the block in half until the requested size is reached (minimum size is 1 page) - the unused half of each block is the *buddy* of the other - when merging back pages, a page can only be merged with its buddy  NOTE: blocks are always a power of 2 number of pages and are tracked in the `free_area`.  ### Page cache  Set of pages that are:  - in memory - swappable - file backed (i.e. have an associated backing store)  The idea is to efficiently use memory by sharing some physical pages and mapping them on multiple processes' VMAs (e.g. shared library code, copy-on-write child process pages).  Each page needs to keep a reference count (how many VMAs map to that page).  ```C struct page {   unsigned long flags;   atomic_t _count;   atomic_t _mapcount;   struct address_space *mapping;   pgoff_t index;   struct list_head lru; }; ```  #### Page Frame Reclaim Algorithm (PFRA)  Based on the idea of the *clock algortithm*, an approximation of the LRU algorithm.  - circular list of pages   - the clock head goes around the list to find some page to evict - each page has a reference bit   - R=1 --> recently used, don't evict but put R=0   - R=0 --> choose to evict     - may want to check if dirty to avoid writes if there are other candidates  In Linux we need a more complex way of managing pages, using the `lruvec`.  - `INACTIVE_ANON` and `ACTIVE_ANON` - `INACTIVE_FILE` and `ACTIVE_FILE` - `UNEVICTABLE`  There is an active and an inactive list, the top of the inactive list is the candidate page to be evicted. A page stays in the active list as long as it gets referenced in by some process.  ![active_inactive_pages](assets/active_inactive_pages.png)  ### Object allocation  Fast allocator for objects that are smaller. In general in the kernel fixed size data structures are ofter allocated and deallocated. The buddy system doesn't scale well, it will lead to fragmentation and inefficient use of the memory.  There are two fast allocators in the kernel:  - quicklists, used only for paging - slab allocator, used for other buffers   - for smaller structures, store many objects in a single page   - for efficiency we have that frequently used structures are prepared and already initialized  ![slab_allocator_implementation](assets/slab_allocator_implementation.png)  A `kmem_cache` structure is present for each type of data structure. It manages multiple caches, one for each CPU. When the page gets full it is swapped to another cache slab. `kmalloc` will look in the slab cache to find a suitable block.  For more info can check `/proc/slabinfo`.  ### Linux memory security  Mitigation against common types of vulnerabilities.  #### Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)  Randomize the base address of the sections in memory to make it difficult to find code to execute. Also available in the kernel (KASLR) to randomize the `.text` section of the kernel at startup.  #### Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI)  To protect against new attacks based on **Meltdown** that exploit the processor speculative execution to leak information.  The idea is to use different PGDs for user mode and kernel mode. The two page tables are adjacent so that to switch mode it is sufficient to change the base.  ![KPTI](assets/KPTI.png)  ## Virtualization  An efficient, isolated duplicate of the real machine dedicated to an OS. It is based on a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM or hypervisor) that creates an environment for an OS and is in complete control of the system resources.  The requisites that the Virtual Machine (VM) must have are:  - fidelity: behaviour equivalent to a real machine - safety: the VM cannot override the hypervisor's control over the resources - efficiency: should have little impact on performance of processes  Why would we want to use a VM?  - consolidate hw resources   - fully utilize each machine resources - react to variable workload   - extend the VM resources when needed - standardize the infrastructure   - easy to replicate a specific environment - security sandboxing - fault tolerance   - can checkpoint or snapshot the machine to be able to rollback to a good state  Some definitions:  - host system: OS where the VM is running - guest system: OS that is running in the VM - virtual machine monitor (VMM) or hypervisor   - mediates access to system resources   - ensures isolation   - type 1 --> runs on bare metal (vmware, esx, hyper-v)   - type 2 --> runs in the context of another OS (KVM, VirtualBox)     - note: sometimes KVM is categorized as type 1 because when enabled it basically turns the OS in an hypervisor (so it's not running in an OS but it is itself the OS)  The idea of virtualization is to execute all instructions (and so also privileged instructions that would normally trap in user mode) in user mode and thus allowing an OS to be executed on top of another.  Instructions that are important for virtualization are those ones that are:  - control-sensitive: instructions that modify directly the machine status (e.g. interrupt disabling, modify IVT, ...) - behaviour-sensitive: instructions that behave differently when used in supervisor mode, those may affect fidelity  THEOREM (Popek and Goldberg): For any computer a VMM can be built if the set of sensitive instructions is a subset of the privileged instructions (note: this is just a sufficient condition, a VMM can be built even if this is not satisfied but it's more difficult).  (basically if there is a way for the hypervisor to catch and manage all actions that could change the machine status or behaviour, i.e. have the complete control of the machine, then it is possible to build it) ### Software based virtualization  Based on the ideas of *deprivileging* and *shadowing*  - deprivileging: running kernel mode instructions in user mode   - sensitive instructions need to be taken care of to ensure fidelity - shadowing: used when the guest needs to access the page table or interrupt descriptor table   - VMM intercepts this calls and redirects the access to a virtual (shadow) copy that is presented to the guest  Privileged instructions are trapped and intercepted by the hypervisor that regulates access or presents a shadow copy of that resource.  #### Page table access  ![guest_os_page_table_access](assets/guest_os_page_table_access.png)  VMM intercepts writes to the page directory `cr3` and redirects to the virtual `cr3`. Physical pages of the guest are actually virtual pages of the host OS, that are then mapped on actual physical memory.  Since the page table of the guest is set to read only by the host, every access that tries to modify it causes a trap to allow the host to build the correct shadows mapping.  Read access doesn't need traps since the mapping is already built.  #### Making it work  The problem of sw virtualization on x86 is that some sensitive instructions are unprivileged (i.e. manipulation of interrupt flags, segment descriptors). The guest OS could not run unmodified on a sw virtualization.  - ring aliasing problem --> by running certain instruction the guest OS can tell that it is not running in privileged mode. It's a correctness problem. - excessive faulting --> all syscalls needed to be trapped by the hypervisor and need to be handled. This is a performance problem.  The solution that was used is to use some binary machine code translation done by the hypervisor --> convert code that was problematic into other instructions that would perform the desired function. This was done on a basic block level and stored in a translation cache.  However, this is still not ideal to do. A better virtualization system needs to rely on some sort of hw support from the platform.  ### Hardware assisted virtualization  The goals of adding hw support to virtualization:  - avoid problems of deprivileging by adding new modes for the hypervisor - allow to save and resume the state of the guest - adapt x86 to obey the Popek-Goldberg - improve performance   - reduce number of traps   - avoid shadow paging overhead  ![hw_assisted_virtualization](assets/hw_assisted_virtualization.png) #### Speeding it up  - Extended page table    ![extended_page_table](assets/extended_page_table.png)      Using the extended page table there are still two page tables but the guest OS is able to manipulate directly its table.   The composition of the two level of indirection is done directly in hw.       This allows to reduce the number of traps caused by shadowing.  - I/O passthrough    Make the guest OS access directly a device without going through the hypervisor.   This can be done by placing a IOMMU (I/O Memory Management Unit) between the OS and the devices to allow them to write directly in the memory of the guest OS by translating to the correct addresses.  ### KVM  Loadable kernel module of the Linux kernel that allows to start and stop VMs. It runs the VM as if it is a normal kernel thread, it can be stopped and restarted, the state is saved in a shared memory area called `vm control block (vmcb)`  Minimal VMM using KVM  ```C int kvm_fd = open(\\\"/dev/kvm\\\", O_RDWR); int vm_fd = ioctl(kvm_fd, KVM_CREATE_VM, 0); chat buf[]= {/* memory initialization data */}; // setup memory of the guest by mapping local buffers // into the physical space of the vm ioctl(vm_fd, KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION, {&buf}) int vcpu_fd = ioctl(vm_fd, KVM_CREATE_VCPU, 0); // the exchange of information between us and // the vcpu is via a 'kvm_run' data structure // in shared memory which we map from vcpu_fd kvm_run *kr = mmap(... vcpu_fd...); // run the VM ioctl(vcpu_fd, KVM_RUN, 0); // on return can inspect the status in the kr struct cout \\u003C\\u003C \\\"Exit reason: \\\" \\u003C\\u003C kr->exit_reason \\u003C\\u003C endl; kvm_regs regs; ioctl(vcpu_fd, KVM_GET_REGS, \\xAEs) cout \\u003C\\u003C regs.rax \\u003C\\u003C endl; ```  ### Paravirtualization  Instead of trying to run an unmodified OS, what if i modify it to make it work better with an hypervisor? From an implementation point of view is like porting the kernel to a new platform, the hypervisor, and explicitly cooperate with it (e.g. instead of accessing the MMU call the hypervisor).  This is also useful to write device driver that are installed in the guest too cooperate with the host and avoid excessive trapping --> `virtio`  ### Containerization  Containers are a way to isolate a set of processes as if they were the only ones running in the system. They may only see a subset of all the available resources.  Containers are not VMs:  - they are normal processes, they run normally on the host OS - no guest OS - kernel is shared across all the containers  ## Devices and I/O  In a modern architecture the CPU has multiple interfaces to interact with different devices.  ![modern_system_architecture](assets/modern_system_architecture.png)  There are 2 main mechanism to do communication with devices:  - I/O ports   - explicit I/O instruction (`in` and `out` instructions, privileged on x86, each devices has its own port number) - memory-mapped I/O   - hw makes device registers available as if they were in memory, that is writing to some specific addresses in memory actually writes on the device register (same for reads)  ### Interacting with a device  - polling, periodically check if some status flag is raised in the device to signal that some data is ready to be taken. Better suited for fast devices (i.e. low wait time) since polling too much is going to waste many cycles. - interrupt, the device itself raises an interrupt when there is some operation to be done. Better to use with slower devices (i.e. that require longer wait) because it requires a switch to kernel mode to be handled by an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).  Interrupts can have very high overhead for trivial tasks (e.g. send bytes of data to a device) so for some application it is better to allow the device to directly access the memory and grab the data itself. This is done using DMA (Direct Memory Access), that manages the communication process with the device and interrupt the CPU only when the data transfer is completed.  ![interrupt_with_and_without_DMA](assets/interrupt_with_and_without_DMA.png)  ### Linux interrupts  Interrupts can be  - asynchronous, generated by hw devices at arbitrary times to signal events (e.g. I/O)   - maskable: can be ignored by the CPU until it remains masked.   - nonmaskable: always recognized by the CPU - exceptions, produced internally by the CPU control unit while executing instructions. Also called synchronous because they are issued on instruction termination.   - fault exceptions: correct and re-execute faulty instructions   - trap  ![interrupt_handling](assets/interrupt_handling.png)  In hardware, when an interrupt arrives, the CPU looks for its handler in the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), that is used to map it to its Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). These routines are stored by the kernel at the location where the CPU expects to find them and contain all the actions that where registered to be done (for instance by driver) to handle that specific interrupt.  All of these actions are done in kernel mode. The handling is usually divided in 3 parts:  ![ISR](assets/ISR.png)  - acknowledge and disable current interrupt - execute the handler - re-enable the interrupt  Ideally the routines to serve an interrupt are very fast to execute (see [defer work](#defer-work)).  Actions can be registered by device drivers:  ```C static irqreturn_t handler(int irq, void *mydata) {     // acquire locks on shared data     // read/write from peripherals through MMIO     // defer work     // release lock     return IRQ_HANDLED; }  static int __init mydriver_init_module(void) {     // allocate space for mydata     ret = request_irq(irqnum, handler, IRQF_SHA, mydata);     // code } ```  #### Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)  ![PIC](assets/PIC.png)  In hardware interrupt are handled by a controller. Originally on uniprocessors systems there was a single PIC that could handle few interrupts and remapped the interrupt number to the correct interrupt vector on the CPU. This approach is very limited and is now superseeded.  ![APIC](assets/APIC.png)  With the advancement of CPUs and multiprocessor systems the APIC (Advanced PIC) was introduced to allow the management of more interrupts and decide policies to dispatch them to CPU. In the APIC it is possible to decide for each Interrupt Request (IRQ)  - which CPU to send it to - what vector it needs to be mapped to - the policy of dispatch in case multiple CPUs can handle the same interrupt   - for instance, to balance load, a certain interrupt could be sent to all CPUs in a round robin way  APIC and the multiple CPUs communicate through a shared bus. Also the CPUs themeselves can send interrupts to other CPUs (Inter-Processor Interrupt IPI) using the same bus.  However also with the APIC there is a problem. There is a sort of \\\"double interface\\\" with the devices:  - interupt sent via the APIC - actual data that is in the memory mapped registers  To solve this issue a new approach has been developed called Message Signaling Interface (MSI)  ![MSI](assets/MSI.png)  The devices send interrupts over the PCIe bus. Up to 32 interrupts per devices can be registered. To see how interrupts are remapped one can look at the `/proc/interrupt` file (APIC behaviour can still be emulated for compatibility).  #### Defer work  The idea is that an ISR need to be as short as possible. To do this the routine can be divided in two parts:  - top half: executed during the interrupt handling   - minimal work to manage the interrupt   - schedule some deferred functions to complete the handling - bottom half: finalizes work by executing the deferred functions   - invoked at a particular reconciliation time  Linux manages deferred work with two mechanisms:  - softIRQs - work queues  ##### SoftIRQ  There are different types of softirq:  - `HI_SOFTIRQ` - `TIMER_SOFTIRQ` - `TASKLET_SOFTIRQ`  Actions are never interrupted but can run in parallel on multiple CPUs. This may require locking some shared structures. In order to avoid this Linux offers the TASKLET_SORTIRQ that forces execution of softirq routines to be serial (i.e. only one can run at a time). They are used to work that should have been done in the interrupt but for responsiveness reasons they are scheduled later.  These tasks cannot sleep or wait for resources.  ![sotfIRQs](assets/sotfIRQs.png)  The execution of deferred work can be done in two places:  - on return from the interrupt itself (call `do_softirq()`), with interrupts enabled   - allowed to run only for a bounded period before returning to user mode - within the `ksoftirqd/cpun` thread at a later time.  ##### Work queues  Used for deferred work when the deferred function can possibly block for some operation (for instance interacting with the device that generated the interrupt).  A work queue is a schedulable entity that runs in process context to execute the bottom half of the interrupt and is submitted to a worker kernel thread `events/n` --> threads waken up by the kernel to do some operations.  #### Timers  Used to schedule some tasks. When some time has passed the timer sends an interrupt to notify that it has expired.  - system timer: programmable piece of hw that issues interrupts at a fixed frequency (called `tick rate` 50-1000 Hz)   - the interrupt handler for this timer (`tick_periodic()`) updates the system time and performs periodic work like updating the `jiffies` and the timeslice of processes - dynamic timers: schedule events that run once (not periodically) after a specified time has passed   - for instance turn off a device after some inactivity   - can be registered by device drivers to schedule actions   ```C   struct timer_list my_timer;   init_timer(&my_timer);   ...   my_timer.expires = jiffies + delay; // timer expires in delay ticks    my_timer.data = 0;                  // zero is passed to the timer handler    my_timer.function = my_function;    // function to run when timer expires    add_timer(&my_timer);               // GO!    ```  ### Device management  Linux integrates devices in special files, assigning them a path name under `/dev`. Devices are divided in two categories:  - character device: no buffering, it's just a character stream. Reading and writing on the file directly impacts the device itself. - block device: seen as a sequence of numbered blocks that can be individually addressed and accessed through a cache.  Each device has a special driver that handles it and it's identified by a *major device number* to identify it and a *minor device number* to distinguish between the multiple devices it can support. (typical example `/dev/sd*` for disks --> `/dev/sda, /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2`)  ![driver_major_minor_number](assets/driver_major_minor_number.png)  Originally under `/dev` there were thousands of files that were there also for devices not currently plugged in. Later only connected devices showed up but there could be issues with devices changing name if the user changes how they are attached.  ![udev_and_sysfs](assets/udev_and_sysfs.png)  In the modern approach there are two orthogonal ways of looking at the devices: - `UDEV`, the user is given the power to customize the device names. Represents a kind of logical view over the attached devices. - `SYSFS`, stored under `/sys`, shows through the file system how the devices are connected to the system, providing a topological view of the system. There is also more information that is available via sysfs:   - state of devices   - which bus they are attached   - access to device driver  #### Writing device drivers  The process differs for character and block devices:  - character devices: need to register functions to handle file operations (`open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, ...)    ![character_device_driver_structure](assets/character_device_driver_structure.png)  - block devices: it's more complex since there are two structures that needs to be registered   - `block_device_operations` to specify an `open` and `release` operations.   - `gendisk` to provide a `request_queue` and a `queue_rq()` function to do the actual I/O operations    ![block_device_driver_structure](assets/block_device_driver_structure.png)    - block I/O requests are actually optimized and scheduled to make the best use of the device     - multiple policies are possible, see later  ##### Scheduling block I/O  - NOOP scheduler: doesn't reorder, forwards directly to the device. It just merges requests for contiguous blocks.    ![NOOP_block_device_scheduler](assets/NOOP_block_device_scheduler.png)  - Complete Fair Queue (CFQ): the goal is to assign to each process a fair slice of disk bandwidth    ![budget_fair_block_device_scheduler](assets/budget_fair_block_device_scheduler.png)    - requests are grouped by process   - scheduler extracts a batch of requests from each queue, iterating over the queues in a round robin fashion   - also called Budget Fair Scheduler (BFS) - MQ-deadline I/O: coalesces block operations but also try to do some prioritization by serving first read requests that are starving.    ![deadline_block_device_scheduler](assets/deadline_block_device_scheduler.png)    - divide requests in 4 queues:     - first two divide read and write operations and are sorted by block number     - second two, also divided by read and write, ordered according to an expiration timer that is assigned to each requests upon arrival     - the logic is to favor reads over writes, unless some of them is expired (i.e. timer is up)     - the scheduler may wait a bit if the read queue becomes empty before issuing the writes\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n",
