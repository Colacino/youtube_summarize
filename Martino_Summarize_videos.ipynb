            "[\"[00:00:00] Okay, so this is wild for me. This is a very big day for me. I don't get star-struck by celebrities [00:00:07] I don't care. I find most of them disappointing frankly. I do get star-struck by [00:00:12] neuroscientists and neurology professors [00:00:15] So you this this actually is a very big deal for me ask the producers [00:00:20] I changed did I not wear a dress and then change into something else before he got here I [00:00:25] I [00:00:27] Put a dress on and then I started sweating and panicking so then I took it off and now I'm put a sweater on which was even [00:00:34] Dumber, so I'm fully flustered. I want to just say that out loud. I don't get flustered by celebrities [00:00:41] I get flustered by scientists [00:00:43] People that listen to this podcast know that I'm obsessed with neurology [00:00:47] In fact, I believe I know more than you do [00:00:50] And you very very well may and if you disagree with anything I say, I'll just cut it out [00:00:56] That's good. So this is like a crazy honor for me. Do you want to just introduce yourself? So I don't screw it up [00:01:01] Sure. Well, first of all, it's great to be here. Thanks for\", \"great to be here. Thanks for the invitation [00:01:04] My name is Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neuroscience and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine [00:01:10] So neuroscience unlike neurology is not the clinical field [00:01:13] So I should just give a disclaimer right off the bat. So I'm not a medical doctor [00:01:18] That means I'm not an MD, which means I don't prescribe anything. Damn it [00:01:21] I'm a research scientist and a professor. So I profess a lot of things [00:01:26] and [00:01:27] People that know me know that this podcast like this is fulfilling the promise of what I wanted to do with this podcast [00:01:34] Which was get these brilliant minds in a room picking their brain [00:01:38] I wanted to be like the Robin Hood of science and neurology and [00:01:43] Therapy and psychotherapy and psychology and stuff so that [00:01:47] People could get this information because I'm lucky enough to be able to meet people like you [00:01:50] And I wanted to give them an opportunity to get inside your head for free. So this is like my dream [00:01:57] I also just want to say real quick that Andrew was just on Rogan. It was a brill\", \"ust on Rogan. It was a brilliant interview [00:02:03] I'm gonna try to not cover a lot of the same things you guys talked about this podcast is more through the lens of [00:02:08] Sex relationships good relationships bad relationships family relationships a work situation sort of how to edify yourself in all parts [00:02:17] Opposed to like athletic performance or something. We don't care about working out over here [00:02:22] But so I'm gonna keep guiding towards that I recommend that everybody listen to the Rogan interview it's unbelievably [00:02:30] Educational and elegant your it's it's very rare that you're able to get a scientist or doctor who is [00:02:36] Charismatic and able to convey what they know in a way that people that aren't scientists can understand [00:02:41] Thank you, you know, so you like you make it simple enough for dumb people like me to actually understand [00:02:46] I'm gonna know you know a lot of neuroscience. We were talking out there. You know a lot about science and science history [00:02:51] I'm not just saying that like your knowledge is pretty bad. I true. I am obsessed spend time on it [00:02:56] I it's my house [00:02\", \"2:56] I it's my house [00:02:57] It's my number one passion is neurology and and let me tell you why it's just so we can frame this [00:03:02] Podcast in this conversation because this is like this is such a big deal for me [00:03:06] And I'm I'm just so excited, you know, I've spent a lot of my life and I'm not gonna say it's just because I'm a woman [00:03:12] I think men, you know get this to we're taught at a very young age that everything is our fault [00:03:16] And we're taught, you know, I think as as a woman you hear a lot relax calm down your psycho [00:03:22] You're crazy. You're too emotional. You're too sensitive, you know, I think for the longest time [00:03:25] I didn't really understand why I made the decisions. I made I just thought I [00:03:30] Was bad in some way and once I started learning about neurology [00:03:33] I actually think it's like a crime that we don't teach neurology in high schools to understand how your brain works and a lot of the [00:03:39] Decisions that are made for you instead of your conscious decisions [00:03:43] and [00:03:45] Now, you know, I think learning neurology helped me have so much more patience with mys\", \" much more patience with myself and so much more [00:03:50] Love and respect for myself of going like, okay, you know, I'm really upset in the situation [00:03:55] But that's adrenaline and cortisol and you know [00:03:58] This reaction is something that would have served me very well in tribal times [00:04:02] Like my brain is very well evolved for a conflict, you know, a thousand years ago [00:04:06] but circumstances have changed and now this tool is obsolete and [00:04:10] Even maybe a liability at this point [00:04:12] So being able to look at your choices and your reactions and your emotions through the lens of understanding neurology to me [00:04:18] It's just like the key to being patient with yourself the key to being hopeful [00:04:23] Especially some of the work that you're doing around neuroplasticity the key to going like, you know [00:04:27] I can change [00:04:29] Myself I don't I'm not doomed to turn into my mother [00:04:31] I'm not doomed to constantly recreate my childhood circumstances [00:04:34] Like I'm not doomed to be in bad relationships forever, you know [00:04:36] So to me, this is the key to feeling hope and patience and self-\", \" hope and patience and self-respect and love [00:04:42] So this is just it's such a big deal for me. Well, it's the right topic if you're interested in [00:04:48] Yourself or if people are interested in themselves and or interested in other people what makes them tick [00:04:53] Mm-hmm. I mean the nervous system, which is the brain and all the connections with the body and back again [00:04:57] Essentially controls all our experience. I mean everything the immune system digestion heartbeat gut microbiome [00:05:04] All that stuff is great and important [00:05:06] But it's actually all controlled by the nervous system in the brain and it's amazing how little we you know [00:05:11] It's just so shocking to me that when I do talk about, you know [00:05:15] I'm obsessed with weighted blankets and you know whether it's placebo or not [00:05:19] But when my sympathetic nervous system is activated [00:05:21] I'm like, I need to get into my parasympathetic numbers. Like, what does that mean? [00:05:24] And I'm like, how is this not just part of our every day [00:05:29] Conversation of how we talk to each other. Yeah, so there are a couple reasons why I think peo\", \"uple reasons why I think people don't know more about the brain [00:05:36] Probably three reasons one is that a lot of the best information is recent [00:05:39] Mm-hmm only really come out in the last 10 to 15 years [00:05:43] The second reason is that there aren't a lot of scientists who are leaving their laboratories and talking to the general public [00:05:49] Yes, they're busy. Yeah, and of the ones that do [00:05:51] They vary in terms of how narrowly focused they are or how much of the field they read about and understand [00:05:57] I'm you know part of the reason I'm here and I've been doing podcasts as I really I want to be an educator [00:06:02] I want to teach people about themselves and about the brain and [00:06:05] I think I would like to also put out the call for more scientists to do similar sorts of things [00:06:10] And then the third reason is that the naming is terrible. So as you pointed out [00:06:15] sympathetic nervous system is like [00:06:18] It actually is the kind of more stress related aspect of the autonomic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system [00:06:24] Which means automatic isn't even an automatic. It's not auto\", \" an automatic. It's not autonomic. And so the naming is terrible [00:06:29] So medical nomenclature and science nomenclature is not it's just it's designed so that everyone's on the same page [00:06:36] Who works on that particular thing? [00:06:38] Right and it almost seems as if it's designed to keep everybody else out of some secret club [00:06:43] But it's not it's just the naming is terrible [00:06:46] So for those of you out there that are listening this I and because you brought it up the sympathetic nervous system is the [00:06:53] aspect of our [00:06:54] Brain and its connections with the body that makes us feel more alert [00:06:57] It makes our breathing speed up that makes us kind of stressed [00:06:59] And the parasympathetic nervous system is the one that makes us more calm the so-called rest and digest system [00:07:04] it's the one that triggers sexual arousal incidentally, so they're now no one will forget it and [00:07:09] Literally, these are two different, you know, your sympathetic nervous system is just from here to your navel [00:07:14] It's the neurons that trigger the all that activation and the release of adrenaline [00:07:18] \", \"se of adrenaline [00:07:18] Everything right here and the parasympathetic nervous system para just means near Simpa means together [00:07:24] So it all happens at once. That's why stress is like boom all it [00:07:26] You have to know Latin in order to figure these basic or Greek [00:07:29] Yeah, that's too much and then the parasympathetic nervous system is the neck [00:07:32] it's the neurons that live along the spinal cord in the neck and in the pelvic area below the navel and [00:07:37] Those control other things right many other things and so like voice [00:07:41] reproductive behavior [00:07:44] Defocation urination all these kinds of things so [00:07:47] But the naming is just dreadful and so one of the things that I'm trying to do and I'm rallying my colleagues to do is to try [00:07:52] And come up with a nomenclature yeah that can evolve to a place where more people can understand it [00:07:57] It's gonna take some time because doctors need to speak doctor speak and scientists need to speak science speak [00:08:03] But I think it is important today [00:08:05] I'll do my best to not use many and hopefully no acronyms, but we don't need more acro\", \" but we don't need more acronyms [00:08:11] But if I do use them all [00:08:13] Be careful to and you do a great job at saying like the fear center of the brain the reward center of the brain [00:08:18] I try you know [00:08:18] I did a movie on about neurology and it took me. I'm not even joking you a week to learn the word fennel ethyl [00:08:25] I mean, I [00:08:27] Literally just walked around my house like fennel ethyl like it was like it's actually [00:08:32] Physically difficult it's a mouthful and then you know people would you know will contact me and say well [00:08:37] You know you were lumping this and this together [00:08:39] I think there's a way to have a conversation about science neuroscience neurology immunology in a way that [00:08:45] My hope is that it'll be clear and that will also some elements will be actionable because I think information is great [00:08:52] But there are great tools to extract from the field of neuroscience that people can implement [00:08:57] Regardless of financial status, etc. They can make their lives better and can help each other [00:09:01] And so I guess I'm basically saying I agree. I think that more peo\", \"agree. I think that more people need to understand science [00:09:07] I'm heavily biased in [00:09:09] in my belief in that but [00:09:11] Anyway, but I just know I want people to like because people often look to me [00:09:16] As some like mental health [00:09:18] Guru and how did you learn to love yourself and how did you learn to have high self-esteem and how did you learn to? [00:09:22] Avoid conflict and you know we say a lot on this show like the only way to win is to not play [00:09:26] Don't get into the ring [00:09:27] Don't you know if someone asks you to dance just don't like all of sort of the ability to control your impulses [00:09:32] You know is something the ability to have something that we call pause the ability to say [00:09:37] I'm not gonna engage in this fight [00:09:38] You know I'm not gonna respond to this email right now to not be so reactive because I think especially now [00:09:43] With what's going on and we're all at like, you know peak stress [00:09:47] Peak aggravation. We're all very reactive and you know to me the key to my life having [00:09:53] Serenity and the key to me having integrity and pride is the ability to cho\", \" pride is the ability to choose [00:09:58] The actions that I take and before I learned about neurology. I don't feel like I had a big choice [00:10:03] I would respond to that text message before I thought I would answer the phone before I was like [00:10:07] Do I really want to take this call like I didn't have the ability to control my behavior in my reactions [00:10:12] And I would make decisions in you know with my head flooded with adrenaline or flooded with dopamine [00:10:18] You know I look at a lot of [00:10:20] Let's just say bad relationships and I look back and I'm like I was just on drugs [00:10:24] Like I look back and some of the decisions that I made under the influence of oxytocin [00:10:29] And it helps me forgive myself. It helps me have more patience for the bad decisions [00:10:33] I've made but it helps me as an adult go [00:10:35] You know what? I'm not gonna respond to this email till tomorrow when I'm not so [00:10:39] Adrenalized and activated and to me understanding the basics of neurology is the crux of [00:10:47] Living a serene life that you can be proud of that's wonderful [00:10:51] I mean the the culture around wellness \", \"the culture around wellness has really grown a lot [00:10:55] Which I think is great the culture and conversation around mindfulness has grown tremendously [00:11:00] We hear that term all the time yeah for scientists the term mindfulness is a little bit [00:11:04] Troubling because we always need to take the opposite. So mindfulness is a great word [00:11:08] It sounds great, but the opposite of mindfulness would be mindlessness or and and I like to think about things so [00:11:16] Philosophy and psychology tend to be more about nouns and adjectives when you think about biology and neurology [00:11:22] It's more about verbs. It's what you would do because everything in biology is a process. So like for instance [00:11:30] Yeah, like verb action so all action [00:11:33] So if we were to say like you just gave a really nice example of how do you create that gap between stimulus and response? [00:11:39] I mean Victor Frankel talked about the gap between stimulus and response the people who are into mindfulness talk about the gap between stimulus and [00:11:45] response like be [00:11:47] Responsive not reactive [00:11:49] So to a scientist or biologist we \", \"a scientist or biologist we hear that and we go well how how does that actually work? [00:11:56] Like how would one actually do that because it sounds wonderful, but then when you get a troubling text message [00:12:00] It's almost instantaneous and you find yourself actually in the behavior of responding. So how do you actually introduce the gap? [00:12:06] So people have talked about you know transcendental vegetation and all beautiful practices, but those take a very long time [00:12:12] Yes, so I think what my translation of what you just said if I may is that when one understands a little bit about their inner [00:12:19] Workings and the chemicals and the systems in the body that cause reactivity. I [00:12:24] believe just that understanding of that knowledge can introduce the so-called gap or prevent you from being so [00:12:30] Reactive you but everybody right you included [00:12:33] from being so reactive [00:12:36] Without having to do anything except just understand that information that the feeling in your body that you want to move that kind [00:12:43] Of like low-level agitation or jitter or text or punch somebody or whatever it happens to b\", \" or whatever it happens to be [00:12:48] That's adrenaline in action [00:12:51] Adrenaline's job was to move your body [00:12:53] So it means that anytime that you feel like you want to do something you may or may not be in [00:13:00] The best position to do the right thing [00:13:02] So anytime that one feels the urgency to say something or do something whether it's a text or to shout at somebody or to [00:13:09] Use if there were an addict or whatever it is fucking man. Exactly. There's a there's a [00:13:14] There's a component there that I think everybody could benefit from understanding [00:13:18] Adrenaline release into the body from this set of neurons in the middle of the spinal cord and that takes half a second [00:13:23] Wow, I've hundred milliseconds from when you find get that information to where you feel like you're gonna move [00:13:29] And so that tells you something you're not gonna put that genie back in the bottle [00:13:32] Hmm, what you need to do is learn how to activate the parasympathetic nervous system the calming [00:13:37] Access of this nervous system and push back on that. So my hope is that just even with some information [0\", \"ven with some information [00:13:42] We can also talk about tools if you like but just even with information [00:13:45] People will really be able to access the so-called gap that the the boundary between stimulus and response the ability to pause [00:13:52] Absolutely without and if you have a meditation practice or people do that. That's wonderful and here's what I'll say [00:13:56] I I'm a fan of meditation. I don't think most people have time to meditate [00:14:00] Well, and there's an additional problem with meditation too, and I'm gonna lose some friends by saying meditation turns into masturbation [00:14:06] I wasn't gonna say that [00:14:08] I'm guessing sometimes it probably does [00:14:11] but [00:14:12] Meditation also [00:14:14] Heightens one's awareness of their inner workings and so the brain has two ways of functioning all the time and it usually is doing both at the [00:14:20] Same time one is called interoception [00:14:23] Which just basically means paying attention to your internal real estate like what's going on inside in my breathing fast [00:14:28] Where's my heart rate at do I feel good am I happy am I sad basically everything wit\", \"sad basically everything within the confines of your skin? [00:14:34] Okay, the other thing is called extra reception, which is perception of everything outside you [00:14:39] Mm-hmm now the nervous system is always measuring both to some degree or another [00:14:43] One might be more of our focus than the other if we see something really dramatic like if I go and I've seen one of your shows [00:14:49] Before I met you I went we'll talk about that. Yeah, that's right. I was at your New Year's Eve show [00:14:53] I think it was in Portland a few years back [00:14:54] And so I was fully in the experience of I was in full exteroception [00:14:58] But when I would laugh I'd feel something so it's kind of going back and forth interception exteroception [00:15:03] Sounds exhausting. No, it was actually a lot of fun. It was actually a lot of fun [00:15:08] The and we're doing it all the time, right? [00:15:11] Except when we're in sleep and then we're fully in our we're only in relation to what's going on inside us [00:15:16] It's like me it's still only in relation to what's going on inside you [00:15:21] So you're only in terrocepting but when people meditate\", \"ing but when people meditate you're increasing that [00:15:26] Interceptive awareness and for people that are anxious that may have social anxiety [00:15:31] To gain more awareness of how you're feeling inside might actually be going in the wrong direction [00:15:35] Because if somebody who has social anxiety goes to a party where they have speaking public speaking anxiety [00:15:40] They don't want to be thinking about what they're feeling [00:15:43] They want to be out of their head yeah out of their body a little bit now [00:15:46] You don't want to be so out of your body that you're not in touch with your body [00:15:49] That's right. So there's a balance there and I think certain forms of meditation actually have led to [00:15:55] Some uncomfortable states for people where they can't get out of their head because they've spent hours sitting there thinking about their own thoughts [00:16:02] So I think there is a place for a meditative practice. I don't want the meditators to come after me [00:16:07] Although I don't feel particularly threatened by a bunch of [00:16:18] That could hurt me that are meditators and I I do have a [00:16:22] Meditation so\", \"e a [00:16:22] Meditation so do I I love that I love that we're worried about getting canceled by the meditators here [00:16:26] Here's I just I believe that everyone's brain everyone's childhood everyone's ancestral trauma [00:16:31] Everyone are different, you know, and I think for me [00:16:34] Everyone meditating the same way at the same time with the same mantra. It's just a little silly [00:16:38] I think all our brains sort of need different things have different capabilities have different bandwidths [00:16:42] I tried to do meditation the way that all the famous people talked about it for so long [00:16:46] It did not work for me. I got bored. I got antsy [00:16:49] I just was not at a place yet where I was ready to close my eyes for 20 minutes if I did reach any kind of [00:16:55] Realization I would fall asleep your brains are I think kind of does what it needs to do [00:16:59] Or I was too uncomfortable because too much pain would come up or emotions would come up or I was too addicted to my phone [00:17:04] Whatever it is, but I did an attachment a [00:17:08] Class that works on your attachment strategies with the sky George Haas and I he ga\", \" sky George Haas and I he gave me a mantra that I loved [00:17:14] Which was I forgive you you forgive me. I forgive myself. It's a forgiveness meditation [00:17:18] It just worked for me. It helped me like release resentments and I was able to kind of incorporate [00:17:23] Releasing resentments into my meditation. That's what works for me [00:17:27] I'm really inconsistent about it. I'm really imperfect about it [00:17:30] Sometimes it's better for me to just like do a moving meditation walking around the block, you know [00:17:34] Like I just think that I [00:17:37] Love what you're saying because a big part of 12-step programs is service is taking the focus off yourself [00:17:41] Because we're so self-obsessed and we're such a narcissist and me me me me me me [00:17:44] And we say your brain is a dangerous place or your mind is a dangerous place. Don't go in there alone [00:17:48] You know, so sometimes meditating is a way to just [00:17:52] Victimize yourself obsess more about something strengthen neural pathways that you should be weakening frankly and we should be doing service [00:18:00] Which is like calling someone else and saying, how are you\", \"else and saying, how are you what's going on with you? [00:18:04] Right because cooperation and productivity makes dope of me and so go do something else [00:18:08] Think about someone else take the focus off yourself for five minutes because we get so myopic when we just self-obsess [00:18:14] Yeah, too much of our focus is in this interception mode [00:18:17] It can be uncomfortable for people and so and there are people who probably need to think about they're thinking a little bit more [00:18:23] And probably certain people that want to think about it or ought to think about it less [00:18:26] Yeah, I mean my lab has been very focused on respiration and breathing and not necessarily breath work [00:18:30] And I say sitting at corner and huffing and puffing and breath holds and stuff [00:18:34] But really just using certain forms of respiration as a way to control the state of mind [00:18:39] Because it's immediate [00:18:40] You don't have to do any training in order to do it and it's very powerful for people to be able to shift from a [00:18:45] State of higher [00:18:46] Activation and stress to a state of lower activation and stress in real time [\", \"on and stress in real time [00:18:50] Right, you don't have to excuse yourself or take 20 minutes each morning with a timer [00:18:54] Right, so respiration and breath work [00:18:56] I think is a very powerful entry point to his meditation used to stress me out [00:18:59] I have to go meditate [00:19:00] I have to go and I'm like the stress that it's causing me to carve out time to meditate is probably [00:19:05] Canceling out the meditation at this point and there is a question as to whether or not a lot of the benefits of meditation [00:19:10] Or because of the slowed breathing and the breathing alone [00:19:13] I don't think we can explain all the positive effects of meditation through the rep that changes in breathing that happen in meditation [00:19:19] But you mentioned walking meditation [00:19:21] Yeah, so walking meditation is a beautiful example of where you're interocepting you're thinking about your experience [00:19:26] But that you have to have a certain amount of extra reception, you know all animals [00:19:30] I know you have a deep appreciation for animals use [00:19:33] Self-motion what we call self-generated optic flow of seeing thing\", \"d optic flow of seeing things pass by their eyes as a way to calm the nervous system [00:19:39] And that's because when the body is moving and there are images flowing by on the retinas or for blind people out there [00:19:47] Auditory scenes so to speak are flowing by it actually has a direct calming effect on the fear center of the brain [00:19:54] This threat detection center of the amygdala with this has now been demonstrated in imaging studies [00:19:59] That and this is the basis of EMDR [00:20:01] I've moved into sensation reprocessing where the eyes are moving from side to side that actually is the eye movement [00:20:06] That is caused by forward [00:20:08] Ambulation by walking or by biking or by running or even for someone in a wheelchair if they're in a wheelchair as long as it's [00:20:14] Self-generated optic flow so moving forward and seeing things pass by your eyes in space [00:20:19] You're quieting the fear centers of the mind and so that's very different than sitting in the lotus position [00:20:25] I don't want to knock on meditation too much [00:20:26] But sometimes just getting into [00:20:29] Forward motion is one of the best remed\", \"ion is one of the best remedies for stress [00:20:32] And it's an ancient one that all animals use all animals with eyes anyway and that can walk [00:20:37] They they know intuitively that when they're stressed they do things like shake off that stress [00:20:42] I think there's a name for that all the day that escapes me at the moment and they walk self-generated [00:20:47] So if anyone's feeling excessive stress, yes, you can meditate [00:20:50] But that will put you into more of an interoceptive boat thinking about what's going on inside you [00:20:54] There's great benefit to just going for a walk not looking at your phone during that walk because then you don't get the [00:21:00] Optic flow or a run or cycling it's so basic. Mm-hmm [00:21:03] But it has a basis in neurology that actually quiets these threat detection centers in the brain [00:21:08] So steal someone's wheelchair is the main takeaway [00:21:12] Steal your grandpa do that in airports every once in a while [00:21:15] I see them wheel up to the thing and then pop up and then start walking out [00:21:17] Does drive drive do that going for a drive or to be or a motorcycle ride or say? [00:\", \"motorcycle ride or say? [00:21:24] Self-motion helps so when you're driving you're not doing much generally except you know steering the wheel [00:21:29] So it would be best to do this through some sort of physical activity [00:21:32] It doesn't have to be very vigorous [00:21:34] Oh, it could but the key thing is self-generated optic flow [00:21:37] So that means being in bodily motion with images passing by you on the retina [00:21:41] This is on the retina, which is just the scene portion of the eye [00:21:44] Excuse me and this is what a treadmill in a gym won't [00:21:48] Interesting and pelotons and those kinds of things where you're looking at images of things passing by sort of mimic it [00:21:53] But you know these are ancient forms of also looking at a screen, which is a light, right? [00:21:59] Right and you're you're focusing your eyes into a narrow channel, which actually raises stress levels anytime your eyes are focused in a small compartment of space [00:22:07] Right whether or not it's a phone or a tablet or or a smaller room as opposed to a big vista [00:22:12] You are increasing the level of alertness in your brain stem through a mecha\", \"r brain stem through a mechanism that links the eyes and the brain stem [00:22:18] Where's the back of the brain if you're looking at a horizon or a panorama [00:22:21] You're naturally disengaging that and you'll err more towards calm [00:22:25] And it's the biological basis for that the idea of if you're seeing sort of in a panoramic way [00:22:30] You're able to look for threats. You're able to see everything around you like it makes sense [00:22:35] Right when you're hunched over looking at a small thing [00:22:37] Isn't the hunched over position part of the reason that being on the phone stresses us out so much is when you hunch over that [00:22:43] Is a defensive position that historically? [00:22:47] We would be hiding we would be being attacked and our body sort of [00:22:51] Automatically [00:22:52] Yes, you fight or fight sorry to me to cut you please do someone's got to it's you're absolutely right [00:22:58] So they're these defensive postures that all animals including humans occupy typically it's gonna be spinal flexion [00:23:04] So, you know, I'm sorry think ab crunch as opposed to spinal extension, which is more relaxed, right? [00:23:10\", \"re relaxed, right? [00:23:10] The there's a fundamental question in neuroscience that my lab and other labs are trying to resolve [00:23:14] Which is to what extent is this stuff bi-directional? [00:23:17] So we know that it's bi-directional means it means we know the stress response control certain behaviors [00:23:22] So let's say the stress response hit my pupils or your pupils will dilate [00:23:26] Uh-huh, which makes us see the world in portrait mode, right like like I'm portrait mode the phone one thing the thing that we're [00:23:34] My favorite you like portrait. Yeah. Yeah, everyone's a photographer with portrait mode now [00:23:38] Well in portrait mode or when the there's a certain amount of adrenaline in your system [00:23:43] The thing that you're looking at looks very clear and everything else looks kind of blurry right that everything else fades away [00:23:49] Tunnel vision and a tunnel vision, which I just want to like really [00:23:53] Dumb things down not because people are dumb because I'm dumb and I just like to really say things like five different ways or five different examples [00:24:00] sometimes [00:24:01] But like if you're d\", \":24:01] But like if you're dating someone they come at you. What the fuck was this text? [00:24:06] The it feels like the only thing in the world, right? [00:24:09] It just sort of like and it is the visual system. So [00:24:14] The back of your eye or these three layers of cells called the neural retina [00:24:18] They're actually a piece of your brain that was pushed out of your brain during development [00:24:21] They're not attached to your brain. Your eyes are actually pieces of your brain [00:24:24] They're the only piece of your brain pushed out of the brain during development out of the skull [00:24:28] Excuse me away from the rest of the brain and when you stress the pupils dilate and you see whatever it is [00:24:36] That's stressing you out the text message the person whatever it is in sharper clear focus than everything else [00:24:42] Yeah, another thing happens, which is your internal. There's like a metronome. That's counting time [00:24:48] Metronome is those little thing that goes. Oh, yeah, excuse me. So it's like tick tick tick tick tick [00:24:51] I'm gonna subtitle everything. So everything outside you will seem like it's moving more\", \"l seem like it's moving more slowly when you're stressed [00:24:58] Yeah internal world will feel like it's going a million miles an hour [00:25:01] Yeah [00:25:01] So if you've ever been in line at the airport and you're late and it your it feels really stressful the person in front of you [00:25:07] Feel it feels like you're taking forever [00:25:08] It looks it feels like things are in slow motion [00:25:10] You feel like you're in quicksand or like trying to walk through mud or something when you're stressed out, right? [00:25:15] If you've ever been in appointment [00:25:16] You know you need to leave for another appointment and you're trying to pay attention to two minutes feels like two hours [00:25:20] Exactly so the other thing that happens is this hunching posture [00:25:24] The other thing is a quickening of the breathing and the heart rate [00:25:26] So there are a bunch of things that happen in the stress response when I said there [00:25:30] There's a big question right now as to whether or not it's bi-directional what I mean is [00:25:35] It's unclear still whether or not [00:25:37] Changing the way that I view the world changing my postur\", \"the world changing my posture will calm me now in general the results point to an answer [00:25:45] That is yes that indeed if I'm stressed for let's say you say something that stresses me out [00:25:50] Yes, I'll get more narrow focus on you and the channel of information that's passing between us [00:25:55] But if I take my vision and I go into what's called panoramic vision where I'm just looking at you [00:25:59] But now I'm seeing the ceiling and the floor and you and everything all at once [00:26:02] That tends to calm me down tends to calm people down. It's not just me right in general when we release that spinal [00:26:10] Flexion and it going more into spinal extension, which means just putting your shoulders back [00:26:14] That's right sitting up straight [00:26:15] It does it has a calming effect largely because it releases some of the musculature of the throat that allows you to speak more [00:26:21] Clearly right voice and intonation is a very very powerful readout of the stress response [00:26:26] And isn't this am I gonna saying this wrong the vagal vagal nerve vagal [00:26:30] So the vagus nerve is a is a set of connections that originat\", \"of connections that originate in the brainstem and neck area the parasympathetic [00:26:37] So it originates here that extends almost everywhere through the body the word vagus actually is [00:26:43] Related to the word vagabond. It means wandering well because the [00:26:47] Anatomist saw just how extensive this connection is and this is the connection to the body that stimulates the kind of [00:26:54] Relaxation so-called rest and digest response the best way to trigger activation of the vagus [00:27:00] Unfortunately is eating because when the stomach is distended it sends a signal that you have enough resources and it's time to relax [00:27:07] But there's a fast why we eat when we're anxious [00:27:09] Yes, so the most ancient and well-developed and still very present today form of stress relief is [00:27:16] ingestion of foods that fill us up or that trigger the activation of [00:27:22] Serotonin so carbohydrates, right carbohydrates are the best known cortisol suppressor [00:27:27] So this is why people drink alcohol they eat carbohydrates [00:27:30] They fill their belly they eat to calm themselves, but that response is actually very slow [00:27:\", \"s actually very slow [00:27:34] The the fastest way that I'm aware of to calm the nervous system when one is stressed is to use respiration breathing [00:27:42] But to use a different connection that runs down the other side of the neck, which is called the phrenic nerve ph [00:27:47] Are enic unnecessarily complicated unnecessarily complicated, but if you want to look it up and you're using an F [00:27:55] It's pH [00:27:58] It's a really interesting nerve connection because first of all it's a very fast pathway the vagus is slow [00:28:03] Yeah, Vegas is like is like walking on the shoulder of the freeway that the you have to get someplace [00:28:09] That's gonna be slow. Whereas the phrenic nerve is a very fast path, right? [00:28:12] It's like that's breathing. That's the fast lane and that's breathing [00:28:15] And there's one pattern of breathing in particular that all animals use all reference animals as many times [00:28:19] I can't because I [00:28:21] Animal behavior as well, which is the physiological sigh [00:28:25] So you you literally have a set of 200 neurons and it's not a hundred and it's not a thousand 200 neurons in your brain stem [0\", \"eurons in your brain stem [00:28:32] That control a particular pattern of breathing that you do anytime oxygen in the environment is low [00:28:38] Or this thing called carbon dioxide which makes us want to breathe and stresses us out, right? [00:28:42] It's too high and that pattern of breathing is to inhales [00:28:48] And [00:28:49] But let me ask you something. I'm really gonna get you learn this [00:28:52] I've been told that I breathe wrong. I've been told I breathe from my chest and not my stomach [00:28:57] Okay, what where is the oxygen coming from exactly when you do those inhales? [00:29:00] Okay, so let's talk. We'll just discuss the neural circuits and anatomy of breathing for [00:29:06] In a two-minute thing with no after I've been told at 37 years old [00:29:10] I was told the other day by a trainer that I don't know how to run that I run wrong [00:29:13] Hmm, and I was told that I breathe wrong, but it's a lot of it is performers [00:29:17] We have to hold our breath for a real long time and then we let it go so I can hold my breath for way too long [00:29:22] Right and opera singers are spectacular at the controlling the system as well [\", \"rolling the system as well [00:29:26] So all right, so the neuro anatomy and anatomy of breathing in two minutes or less [00:29:32] You have two centers in your brain one controls rhythmic breathing rhythmic means inhale follows exhale falls inhale falls exhale [00:29:39] Just like Dave follows night this area if you want to remember it [00:29:42] It's called the pre-bots singer complex [00:29:44] But the best way we remember it is it was named after a bottle of wine by a very prominent and important breathing researcher at UCLA named Jack Feldman [00:29:52] Anytime you're breathing inhale exhale inhale exhale you're using the what's called the the wine center of the brain just [00:30:00] the wine or center the the other breathing center is [00:30:05] It's called the para facial nucleus that doesn't matter [00:30:07] But the reason it's called para facial is it's it's an area that controls breathing that violates inhale exhale inhale exhale allows you to [00:30:15] Inhale twice exhale twice inhale three times [00:30:17] The reason you have this area in your brain and everyone has this area in their brain is because you need to coordinate breathing was sp\", \" coordinate breathing was speaking [00:30:23] So when you're on the example you just gave is perfect when you're on stage and you're you're about I don't know [00:30:28] You're making a sprint towards a [00:30:31] Punchline [00:30:35] Our terms are way more simple than yours. Yeah, a joke a set up a joke [00:30:42] You guys should take a hint from comedians, so there's a Latin name. No, I'm just kidding [00:30:46] Yeah, so the you have this brain center that controls non-rhythmic breathing [00:30:51] They both control a really important muscle in your belly called the diaphragm [00:30:56] And the important thing to understand about the diaphragm is its skeletal muscle [00:30:59] So just like a bicep or tricep or quadricep. Yeah, this organ we call the diaphragm was designed to be moved [00:31:06] Voluntarily or involuntarily which is very different than your heart or your spleen or your liver which we have no control [00:31:12] You have no direct control over [00:31:14] So there's a particular pattern of breathing which is two inhales followed by a longer exhale. Maybe repeated [00:31:20] two or three times that [00:31:22] triggers activation of the phre\", \"ggers activation of the phrenic nerve to diaphragm and [00:31:25] It causes your lungs to bring in [00:31:29] Oxygen and it [00:31:31] Reinflates these little sacks in the lungs called the aviolian. I'm running through this very fast [00:31:35] But what it does is it balances the ratio of carbon dioxide and oxygen in your bloodstream and lungs and [00:31:41] Basically what it does is it makes you go from too anxious to calm [00:31:45] So if anyone wants to try this it's two inhales and it's not the same as taking one deep breath or doing one long [00:31:51] I'm in traffic. I'm late for my flight. I just read a crazy piece of news that school is not coming back in [00:31:56] I just saw a speech from Fauci like I just saw someone in a mask or not in a mask or whatever and [00:32:01] I feel myself getting activated. I feel you know when you feel the tingly in your [00:32:06] Chest and start sweating or you feel that sort of bout of rage [00:32:11] It's starting come over you right where it's not you can use to inhale through your nose once [00:32:16] Then you inhale again at the top, but is my is my is my we'll talk about that [00:32:23] Is my chest suppose\", \"0:32:23] Is my chest supposed to go up the way it just did or is my belly supposed to go out [00:32:31] You haven't excelled yet. No, I don't exhale. I've never do I get no oxygen in my body [00:32:37] The woman said to me she goes you are not using even 10% of your life force. These are the okay [00:32:43] I'm not gonna counter someone else's [00:32:45] This was like a healer that like I paid by check [00:32:48] So unless Whitney cracks a joke right in the middle what you want to do is inhale through your nose [00:32:54] Then inhale again at the top a [00:32:56] Little bit more than exhale to my nose exhale either one. So ideally it's nose nose mouth and then [00:33:04] longer breath longer exhale I [00:33:09] Contact makes me nervous, so it's making me more stressed out that you're looking at me [00:33:13] Okay, okay wait to inhale warm today, too. So and then long exhale [00:33:20] That's interesting. Okay. Why is it? What am I broken? No [00:33:24] Disaster no not at all. Tell me that pattern of breathing is what animals do right before they lie down for him now [00:33:30] I feel dizzy you do it. Do you really I when I take a deep breath? [00:33:33] \", \"e a deep breath? [00:33:33] I start I feel high do a shallower breath on the first one. Don't breathe in so deeply on the first one [00:33:39] So go wait inhale [00:33:50] Inhale again at the top and then [00:33:53] But more like I have coffee [00:33:56] Okay, so I'm gonna drown just double inhale long exhale pattern of breathing is important because it's mother-in-aid perfect [00:34:05] So it's much it's similar to the Moz but people who aren't pregnant or or and men who as far as I know still [00:34:12] Maybe there have been so many I'm probably pregnant that um anyone can do this and it's [00:34:17] It's nature's natural way nature's natural [00:34:20] It's nature's hardwired way of letting the nervous system these neurons in the peripheral nucleus control the phrenic nerve control [00:34:27] The diaphragm control the lungs control oxygen to carbon dioxide ratios it translates to calm the fuck down exactly [00:34:33] so [00:34:34] It's very important [00:34:36] That people have this tool in my belief because it doesn't require any breath work or training [00:34:41] You don't have to take a class is it's available to you at all times [00:34:44] I suppo\", \"all times [00:34:44] I suppose unless you're underwater or something like that now [00:34:47] It's not terribly covert like we're in an argument and suddenly I'd start hearing you know double inhale long exhales [00:34:54] There's an additional tool [00:34:56] That's so passive aggressive if someone you're dating starts to fight with you know, it's like right [00:35:01] It's a sigh. I mean, I guess I roll [00:35:04] You don't I roll because that's fucking right. I'm not aware that you're doing that thing or you do your breathing thing [00:35:09] I mean a number of important arguments have been won or lost on the basis of the inclusion of the eye roll [00:35:15] That's a non peer review about doing it is about how you do it. You're not allowed to roll your eyes [00:35:22] Okay [00:35:24] Taking a little break from neuroscience now [00:35:29] Taking a little break from me being a crazy person around a neuroscientist [00:35:34] To talk about magic spoon. I'm getting worried that magic spoon is the only thing I eat [00:35:41] Yeah, it's true. The only thing you eat [00:35:43] I am obsessed with magic spoon dude. It is because I grew up on cereal. I used to e\", \"ew up on cereal. I used to eat [00:35:50] member on Applejack's oh [00:35:52] Yeah, I used to mix Applejack's and cinnamon toast crunch and that's all I like a cereal [00:35:58] I just live for cereal. I love cereal too, and I love the most cereal is really bad for you [00:36:03] Yeah, I love magic spoon because it lets you eat like a child [00:36:06] But also allows me to work on you know, not being shit like a baby zero sugar [00:36:11] Literally zero sugar 12 grams of protein three net grams of carbs in each serving. I eat this after dinner [00:36:18] dessert [00:36:21] At like 11 o'clock at night, you don't feel guilty. You don't feel gross. You don't feel like [00:36:26] You're just full no like shame spiral [00:36:29] My favorite are the fruities. Oh, that's a little chill in the nose for me. So I like the frosted ones [00:36:34] You call me unoriginal with my cereal choice. You know it's calling me gay [00:36:39] The cocoa are good too sometimes I'll do the cocoa with chocolate on the milk and it is so decadent taste amazing [00:36:47] Gluten-free the one's are good too. Don't give don't leave them out [00:36:50] I like the frosted too, but the fr\", \" the frosted too, but the fruities definitely I'm a big fan of blueberry which only comes out on Halloween [00:36:56] And that is a good so friendly gluten-free grain-free soy-free low carb GMO free Benton [00:37:03] Did you just lose 20 pounds? I did do you think magic spoon? [00:37:06] I mean it definitely an instrumental part of your weight loss journey. Yes, because I hate eating breakfast [00:37:12] This is not even a joke. I hate eating breakfast [00:37:14] Also, there's not a camera looking at me, but also [00:37:17] I don't like eating breakfast. Yeah, and this is so easy to eat and it feels like I'm eating a treat [00:37:23] So, I mean it did help [00:37:27] Magic spoon you guys know I'm obsessed with magic spoon magic spoon comm slash Whitney grab a variety pack [00:37:33] Try it today.

[00:38:52] I've already bought it. Yeah [00:38:54] Just cuz I'm shaped like a billboard doesn't mean I want to be one [00:38:58] But italic doesn't do that you can just you can cut out the middle man luxury handbags [00:39:03] Kashmir sweaters active wear bedding bath towels. I need some of those cook where I don't need some of those [00:39:08] You definitely that an even diamond jewelry. So if you want to propose to me [00:39:14] budget [00:39:16] So when I have to buy my engagement ring for myself [00:39:20] From the best possible manufacturers in each category be smart. Don't pay a thousand dollars for a logo. That's ridiculous [00:39:27] It's rigamarole. Don't be a sheep all save your money for more important things [00:39:32] Like my merch [00:39:36] 93% of new members are breaking even on their first purchase. Wow saving an average of [00:39:42] 746 dollars per year with their membership. I mean think of all the things you could buy for 746 dollars [00:39:47] One one new tooth. That's [00:39:51] 746 things from the dollar store. Yeah [00:39:53] That's a good one [00:39:56] There's curr\", \" one [00:39:56] There's currently a wait list to join italic, whoa [00:40:01] But they're offering my listeners to skip the wait and join immediately when you sign up through this link italic [00:40:08] ITALIC.com slash Whitney sign up for the membership now [00:40:12] I get access to italics high quality beautifully designed products to improve your closet home kitchen and more [00:40:19] Don't pay for those silly goose markups again [00:40:22] The other thing is this panoramic vision thing [00:40:24] So if somebody has an issue with public speaking or they're being they're trying to take in information [00:40:29] They're feeling stressed or whatever it is whatever the cause of stress is this panoramic vision thing is powerful because it releases the stress [00:40:36] system to the point where you can see [00:40:39] Space more you see more of the environment that you're in but what's really important is that to understand is that when one is in the [00:40:45] Stress response remember that internal metronome starts going tic-tic-tic-tic-tic and everything outside you seems like it's going really slowly [00:40:51] When you go into panoramic vision, which \", \"nto panoramic vision, which is not looking around all over the place [00:40:54] It just means keeping your head nice still, but right now I'm gonna do it [00:40:57] I'm gonna dial out my gaze so that I can still see you but I can see the ceiling and the floor [00:41:01] I can see myself in the environment that I'm in is it is very calming is the opposite of sort of the [00:41:07] Idea of like being cornered. Yeah, do you know what I'm saying like when if I attack you and go [00:41:13] What the fuck was that let's say and you're here if you want panoramic vision [00:41:17] Does that mean walking outside leaving the room changing your position in the room? [00:41:20] So ideally you would view a horizon outside. Okay when you go to the beach [00:41:25] You just naturally do this when you see a vista you're hiking you naturally got part of the reason [00:41:29] My sunsets and beaches are probably more relaxing [00:41:31] A big part of that but if you're indoors you can also do this [00:41:35] We've tested this in a VR format claustrophobia, etc [00:41:38] But I don't I won't go into the studies in detail [00:41:40] But you can do this in any environment even\", \"this in any environment even on an airplane or in a car if you're claustrophobic [00:41:44] If you combine this with the Psi the double inhale exhale [00:41:47] Just then it's gonna have even more of a positive effect in terms of calming [00:41:51] The other thing that's interesting about this panoramic vision is that animals? [00:41:56] That are very placid [00:41:58] Now I know horses can be very aggressive, but I know you know a lot more about horses than I ever will but [00:42:04] But grazing animals cows sheeps horses. They only see the world in panorama, right? [00:42:10] And what's interesting is if if a member of one of their species is you know injured or hurt [00:42:16] You know you see these gazelles won't get attacked by a line [00:42:18] You see these things on the youtuber nature specials five minutes later [00:42:21] The rest of them are just like grazing around that we would be traumatized right if suddenly [00:42:26] You know one of us was killed with that location would forever hold a feeling of trauma and trouble [00:42:31] They are so placid all the time that they actually have a hard time staying in the stress right now [00:42:37] Ho\", \"ress right now [00:42:37] Horses might be different and we could talk about that because horses can actually move their eyes forward when they enter the stress response [00:42:43] Mm-hmm. So the point here is that when you're in panoramic vision, so you're dialing out your gaze so to speak [00:42:49] You are not only calming yourself internally at the level of the brainstem, but you also start to [00:42:54] Measure time differently. You feel like you have more time, right? [00:42:58] So almost all reactive states are states in which we feel like we have to respond and time is moving very quickly [00:43:04] Got that text you got that email. I got to respond. I got to respond most [00:43:08] Incarcerations bad decisions things we wish we didn't say the imp the impulsivity [00:43:13] Yes is caused by feeling that time pressured right and space pressured being cornered as is I love that example [00:43:19] Because yeah, I think I'm just trying to put it in the terms [00:43:22] We understand of like if I'm in a situation where you know, I'm an altercation is possible [00:43:28] I want to be able to just have the tools to say you know and we talk about this a l\", \"w and we talk about this a lot on the podcast is like [00:43:33] what happens in that second between [00:43:35] Getting stimulated getting activated and taking an action and how a lot of us are addicted to taking an action and being reactive and then [00:43:41] Sending one email can fuck up your whole month sending one email before you were ready saying one thing that you shouldn't have fucking said [00:43:48] You know, I'm obsessed. You know, we say in in 12-step programs. Don't just do something sit there [00:43:53] How do you just fucking sit there and do nothing as long as possible? [00:43:57] You know, and it's it's we sit around and talk about doing something doing something but doing nothing is way [00:44:02] Harder, you know, one of my favorite quotes is sometimes the best battle strategy is a masterful retreat [00:44:07] But how do you do it and how do you get that self-control? [00:44:10] And this is what you're such a genius in your work about but in a in an altercation or possible altercation [00:44:17] The tools of being saying of being saying that's nothing. That's Latin. You probably don't understand it [00:44:21] It's too advanced for you\", \"1] It's too advanced for you [00:44:23] But being able to say to someone, you know what I need to take a walk. I'm feeling cornered [00:44:28] You know just being able to say that going for a walk getting your panoramic vision activated taking those deep breaths [00:44:35] Like that can truly change your life. I mean to me that is the difference between [00:44:39] You know fucking up a marriage fucking up a relationship [00:44:42] You know forever scarring a family member saying something you don't mean saying it mean whatever or nowadays [00:44:48] You know saying the wrong thing on the street someone triggers you you say the wrong things are out [00:44:53] And like there goes your professional life [00:44:55] That's right because someone's recording because didn't you lost your shit in Trader Joe's because you couldn't take these three fucking deep breaths [00:45:00] Right, there are exceptions to what I'm about to say [00:45:02] But what was taught to me a long time ago by my graduate advisor who was a very thoughtful [00:45:08] Extremely smart and very deliberate person was you rarely get in trouble for what you don't say and there are times when we \", \"and there are times when we need [00:45:15] To speak up obviously, but that ability so to introduce the gap [00:45:18] Mm-hmm between stimulus and response in my belief and as a big motivation in my work [00:45:23] Is that that shouldn't require a decade of meditative training? It shouldn't require no one has that kind of extensive extensive training and HR [00:45:31] Will have written me up by that [00:45:33] Like I need I would like to figure out the way to give people tools right now of how to not take the bait the next time [00:45:40] Your boyfriend calls you a bitch or your mom rolls her eyes at you like what I like [00:45:43] How do you not take the bait is another way to put it? [00:45:46] Well those two tools will help people calm quickly. They're the fastest tools that I'm aware of they don't require a lot [00:45:51] Of training or anything you were born with these neurons [00:45:54] Everyone has these neurons think of them like levers and buttons that were installed in you and you didn't know because you mainly do the sighing and sleep [00:46:00] Yeah, and you claustrophobics do it in claustrophobic environments, but [00:46:04] The important th\", \" [00:46:04] The important thing to understand is that other animals more intuitive than us do this [00:46:10] They know to do this they do these sighs when they get stressed [00:46:13] They know to look at try and get into panoramic vision or into self-generated optic flow [00:46:18] Yeah, I'm their amygdala. They don't know what an amygdala is they don't care [00:46:21] But they know to do this stuff intuitively humans are amazing because we have two things that make us special [00:46:27] which are a [00:46:29] Forebrain that allows us to make plans. Yeah in light of what we know about the past and what we think might happen in the future [00:46:36] That's an amazing capacity. Yeah, my dog might make plans [00:46:39] But if he does he doesn't implement them at least not over a long time scale, right? [00:46:44] He's just I mean he might have brilliant ideas, but he doesn't implement [00:46:47] I think a big part of what I love so much about dogs is my dogs are always so so psyched to see me [00:46:53] Even though they saw me two minutes ago, right? They have no concept of time, right? [00:46:57] They're living in the moment, which is beautiful, but they\", \"which is beautiful, but they also don't develop any technologies [00:47:01] Yeah, which is you know, but we do and the other thing is neural plasticity [00:47:05] Which is the brain's ability to change in response to experience [00:47:08] But if you think about it both that ability to make plans in light of what we know from the past and [00:47:14] Neuroplasticity it's a it truly is a double-edged sword because on the one hand we have amazing technologies planes and iPhones and incredible things [00:47:23] Neuroplasticity can allow us to learn new things unlearn things develop new relationships to people places and things [00:47:28] But neural plasticity is also the basis of trauma and neural plasticity is essentially for someone like myself [00:47:34] Who's still trying to understand it it basically is to concede that the brain can change it can evolve [00:47:39] You can make new neural pathways [00:47:41] That's right. There are a couple ways that the brain can change itself. It can add new neurons that actually can happen [00:47:47] It's a little less common than the other forms of neural plasticity, but you can lose connections [00:47:52] Which sound\", \"tions [00:47:52] Which sounds terrible, but actually a lot of learning is the removal of connections learning [00:47:57] So a baby that's flopping around like a little potato bug or whatever. You can tell I don't have children [00:48:02] You know, and then you know a year later you go back and you see in this kid is walking and talking [00:48:07] Wait, what's a potato bug those things that just like curl up or like a roly-poly. Yeah, what is that? [00:48:13] Would you call them? Yeah, I guess a millipede. No, I think no, they're like, yeah, but babies are kind of always potato bug [00:48:18] Is that I mean babies are wonderful, but they're they're kind of what do you call a box with juice in it with a straw juice box? [00:48:24] Really, I call them a sip up. I [00:48:26] Love East Coast West. Yes. I wait so so soda or I say coke for everything. Oh, I think it's a pop [00:48:34] Western thing you say coke about everything fresco sprite [00:48:39] Diet right dr. Pepper a pepper a dr. Pepper. Okay, we fucked with dr. Pepper. I'm from but yeah [00:48:44] Rolly-poly is one of the I think dividing [00:48:47] Factors in American linguistics a potato bug versus \", \"uistics a potato bug versus a roly-poly a juice box versus a sip up [00:48:54] What do you call a thing that's like a little [00:48:57] You draw with it as a kid and it's a bunch of colors at your skit [00:49:01] It's a thing that crayons crowns if we call them crowns or crowns or what you wear like a crown [00:49:06] Yeah, that's what we call it crayon cement or cement [00:49:13] Sorry, I heard something different there for a second. That was [00:49:20] I'm a biologist so we use a different word entirely [00:49:23] Um [00:49:28] I'm not gonna go down. I'm not gonna [00:49:31] The gap between you just saw it happen. You just saw pause. That's right. You just saw it non-reactivity [00:49:44] Where was I everywhere, okay, so a baby doesn't do much their motor patterns are really uncoordinated [00:49:50] They don't do much. Yeah in the course of the first year or two. They go to very deliberate [00:49:55] Motor control and behaviors. They start speaking etc. That's mainly due to loss of connections, believe or not pruning a way of connections [00:50:03] So I a lot of people think that neural plasticity is all about new connections [00:50:06] It's also loss \", \"s [00:50:06] It's also loss of connections, right an addict who is absolutely [00:50:11] Compelled in every way to use cocaine who gets clean and stays clean [00:50:16] Yeah, likely removes as many neural connections that represent cocaine and its relationship to the dopamine pathway [00:50:22] So can I just say real quick part of the reason why when you hear rehabs are 30 days, right? [00:50:26] 30 days 60 days 90 days and these sort of feel arbitrary in some way [00:50:29] But isn't it 28 to 30 days to make a new neural pathway or sort of atrophy an old one set [00:50:35] The more intense an experience and unfortunately the more negative experience is [00:50:40] The more quickly neural plasticity is engaged. There is something called one trial learning [00:50:44] You touch a hot stove once it hurts. I got it. You don't do it again. That's because mother nature wired us [00:50:51] You know the brain and nervous system are wired to keep us safe first before it once allows us to be happy [00:50:57] Yes, actualized, whatever the verbiage is. Yeah, we're not designed to be living in bliss. We're designed to survive [00:51:04] That's right [00:51:04] We have\", \"t's right [00:51:04] We have a natural fear of heights for instance of depth babies will develop that very early without any training [00:51:10] Most everything else has to be learned most everything else. I know you're very interested in this topic [00:51:16] But but just to kind of put a little bit of a bow although we won't [00:51:19] Since I don't know how to tie a proper bow wrap a present anyway [00:51:22] I won't tie it. Well, so we can leave it kind of partially open [00:51:25] But the the point is that neural plasticity is the ability for your nervous system and brain to change in response to experience [00:51:31] I say nervous system because I want people to really [00:51:35] Understand that it's not just what's going on in the skull [00:51:37] It's also the these eyes the visual the brain that's outside the skull as well as in the spinal cord [00:51:41] There's no plasticity all over the gut brain. There's plasticity there two kinds of plasticity generally [00:51:48] Maladaptive like after a brain injury right and adaptive if we talk about plasticity [00:51:52] We'll probably be talking about adaptive plasticity and then there's child plastici\", \" then there's child plasticity [00:51:56] Which is everything up until about about age 25 right and that happens very quickly very easily [00:52:02] That's just learning right learning is that learning but I feel like after 25 it turns into plasticity [00:52:09] I'm an expert on this because it's I [00:52:12] You know kids learn it they absorb everything really easily. It's harder once you turn 25 sure [00:52:16] It's a little bit semantic, but since you're interested in this and I'm guessing some of your audience is [00:52:21] Two guys turns out it was guys David Hubel and Torrance and Weasel who incidentally were my scientific Torrance and Weasel [00:52:27] He's still live 92 years old still runs miles a day sharp of mind and an incredible human [00:52:34] Wow, I am biased. They're my scientific great grandparents. They won the Nobel Prize with a guy here at Caltech named Roger Sperry [00:52:41] For their work illustrating critical periods, which are periods from birth [00:52:45] Until about age 25 and humans when the brain is very plastic right so we do call that neural plasticity [00:52:51] But we call it developmental plasticity like I feel like you\", \"sticity like I feel like you don't get points for it [00:52:55] That's that's where I'm going. Well, it's the basis of fire together wire together [00:52:59] Which was if you've ever heard fire together wired it you just do something again and again [00:53:04] And your brain is reshaped in accordance to that behavior [00:53:07] It's like learning a language when you're 15 versus learning a language when you're 40 and since I'm a scientist [00:53:11] We have to properly credit people a lot of people think that [00:53:14] Someone on Instagram or in the wellness space developed fire together wire together [00:53:18] They did not fire together wire together is the words and important discovery of my colleague Carla Schatz [00:53:24] Who's at? [00:53:25] Stanford who is a remarkable scientist. She was David in Towardston's graduate student and she was the one who really [00:53:34] Made the key discovery showing that repeating a behavior or exposure to a particular environment during development [00:53:40] Makes the brain a map of that experience for better or for worse better or for worse [00:53:46] Then starting at about age 25 you get what's called adult pl\", \"u get what's called adult plasticity, which does not you're trying to undo all the shit from your childhood [00:53:54] Neuroplasticity is kind of the great promise of neuroscience to undo traumas. That's right [00:53:58] And for a long time people thought that adult plasticity wasn't possible [00:54:03] But a guy came along his name is Mike Mersenek and he really pushed this [00:54:08] Hard he said look if something is intense enough or you focus on it enough [00:54:14] Or if you get the right combination of chemicals released in the brain in particular [00:54:18] Dopamine and acetylcholine and we can talk about these if you like in detail [00:54:22] Then adult neuroplasticity is possible and the experiments that he and his graduate students and postdocs did and now many [00:54:28] Hundreds of labs have done [00:54:30] Have essentially proven that adult plasticity is possible. You can learn new things as an adult [00:54:35] You can unlearn things you can people can get sober they can get over traumas the ways to do this are many [00:54:41] We can talk about but they're all grounded in a certain set of principles [00:54:44] You have to be alert for the le\", \" have to be alert for the learning. You have to be focused on exactly what you're trying to learn [00:54:49] Which is I think this is something that was so [00:54:52] Profound unfortunately, this was profound to me [00:54:55] Listening to you on Rogan because it was like I'll read through self-help books. I'll go to the gym [00:55:00] But I'm ha I am half-assing it. We are all half kind of focused on our phone [00:55:04] We're kind of texting at the same time [00:55:06] It is very rare that I'm just doing one thing [00:55:10] 100% and then I'm annoyed I don't get the results I want but I do believe that we sort of it's kind of an epidemic how [00:55:18] Our attention is so [00:55:22] Divided yeah, absolutely, and we don't even realize it. It's become the new normal [00:55:25] We not only can we multitask, but we were designed to the multitask [00:55:30] There's it we can do what's called covert attention [00:55:33] Which is you can talk to me and pay attention to something that's going on in the corner of the room at the same [00:55:37] Time you can split your attention and then I might send an email to the wrong person by accident [00:55:42] About the p\", \"ident [00:55:42] About the person or you can bring both spheres of attention to one location [00:55:45] You can interocept you can pay attention to for instance to how quickly you might be breathing at this moment while paying attention to what I'm [00:55:52] Saying or you can bring a hundred percent of your attention to your breathing or a hundred percent of attention to what I'm saying [00:55:56] Right you can do this in a very dynamic way [00:55:59] What Mersenne and colleagues have shown is that if you want to trigger neural plasticity you want to learn something you [00:56:05] Want to unlearn something you want to bring the maximum amount of [00:56:08] Mental focus to whatever it is that you're trying to change and that feels like to take Adderall [00:56:14] Well, that's actually what Adderall does [00:56:17] It's a stimulant and it triggers the release of the neurochemical neuroepinephrine or in some cases epinephrine [00:56:24] That trigger alertness acetylcholine is like a spotlight [00:56:28] Mm-hmm [00:56:28] And then the key thing is that the actual plasticity the actual rewiring of the connections does not occur [00:56:34] During the learning\", \"0:56:34] During the learning it occurs during sleep and deep breath [00:56:37] So this is where knowing how to calm oneself down not just to sleep better. Although sleep is one component [00:56:43] I can I just put it in layman's turn sure like I will if I'm like trying to study [00:56:48] Jokes to memorize like I'm trying to figure out a time when I can go out and do stand-up [00:56:51] And I had to like literally go back and like [00:56:53] Rememorize the jokes I was doing before the pandemic and I can't get it [00:56:57] I can't I'm trying to do it and then I go to sleep and I wake up and I have it [00:57:00] Lock and step totally memorize and that's because during sleep is when the connections [00:57:04] Between neurons are changing so sometimes the best thing you can do if you're at an eight-hour workday [00:57:08] And you've been working on something you're trying to memorize it or the best thing you can do is just go to sleep [00:57:12] That's right [00:57:13] And if you're not gonna sleep go into a state of deep relaxation of some kind just lie there [00:57:18] I'm a big fan of this [00:57:20] Process yoga nitra, which is what actually means yoga\", \" is what actually means yoga sleep. You can find scripts for this online [00:57:25] They involve ambient it could but in general it involves just lying down and it walks you through [00:57:32] Some breathing and some focus the kind of body scan type stuff that brings the brain [00:57:38] Into a state that's very similar to sleep and it does seem to accelerate neuroplasticity [00:57:42] This is a practice that my lab studies [00:57:44] We we take away all the naming and fancy [00:57:46] Yeah, kind of who stuff and just focus on the physiology the breathing in the brain states [00:57:51] but it's a very powerful tool for [00:57:54] Encouraging the nervous system to learn faster and for people that have trouble sleeping a lot of trouble in falling asleep [00:58:00] Is turning off your thoughts which is turning off the thing that makes you able to focus [00:58:04] So you can see how neuroplasticity is tricky [00:58:06] It's a combination lock that says focus and then defocus [00:58:10] Yeah, and very few people learn how to master that but if you can learn how to master that you we do not know [00:58:16] If there are any upper bounds any limits on plasticity\", \"nds any limits on plasticity there probably aren't [00:58:21] What we do know is that it's harder to learn as an adult than it is as a child [00:58:26] But if you think alertness and focus to trigger plasticity and then deep rest and relaxation to [00:58:33] Solidify to create the plasticity you just keep toggling back and forth between those [00:58:37] Then you're well on your way to reshaping your nerve connections your brain in the ways that you want [00:58:42] I think under even just like you said having an awareness of it like the person I when I was 25 and [00:58:48] You know the guy I'm dating gets a text from an exit to in the morning or gets a nude [00:58:52] But whatever it is and I'm like that actually happen. Oh, I'm sure [00:59:00] Of course that you know or like you the phone has changed relationships tremendously in a big way good and bad [00:59:06] We can we can sort of get into the phone and what that does to the brain at some point because I'm of course fascinated by that [00:59:10] But I mean I'm up. I'm screaming. I'm crying. I'm slamming the door [00:59:15] I'm just can you can we just talk through what happens to your brain and your\", \"ppens to your brain and your judgment? [00:59:21] When you are scared, I mean right now we're all in peak fear obviously with what's going on in the news [00:59:27] But in our interpersonal relationships or even for a lot of people, you know myself included [00:59:32] Your man getting a text for a nude photo at two in the morning or some text from an ex or something can be the same as your dad [00:59:38] Going oh really? Oh congrats like not being proud of you or your your mom saying or your sister saying something [00:59:44] That's just like, you know, I know that you know [00:59:47] My family members can devastate me with just like one little passive aggressive comment or backhanded [00:59:52] You know whatever that where that little gap in your force field is right and I just want to just talk to you know [00:59:57] About what happens to your brain? Sure when you're on those drugs. So the [01:00:03] Situations vary tremendously from person to person but what you just described really illustrates the fact that we have one stress response system [01:00:11] one and it's designed the same way regardless of what the stressor is and so [01:00:16] The stress\", \"and so [01:00:16] The stress response is very generic [01:00:18] So whether or not it's the troubling text that you see whether or not it's the lack of affection [01:00:24] Whatever it happens to be that's the trigger the important thing to understand is it's very fast [01:00:29] It goes from the mind so you perceive that thing [01:00:31] It's different from person to person [01:00:33] But you hear that thing or you don't hear that thing you're triggered half a second 500 milliseconds [01:00:38] The body is engaged also the signal goes down to that court center [01:00:42] This body react before your brain brain reacts first [01:00:46] Brain reacts first. I mean there are there are exceptions to that. Mm-hmm. They're always exceptions [01:00:52] Where you know like a pain stimulus you might have a defensive posture first then it's conscious [01:00:56] But but these brain areas in the so-called limbic system [01:00:59] Limit just means edge because it's at the edge of the brain [01:01:01] But you can think about it as like falling off of your edge when the limbic system being near the edge [01:01:05] Yeah, the limbic system gets activated it sends a signal\", \" activated it sends a signal the body [01:01:09] Then the body liberates adrenaline so now the body's engaged to see I want to start doing this in arguments [01:01:14] I'm gonna be like my limbic systems activated. Yeah, well, you see people I always think well everything [01:01:18] I think is like through the lens of neuroscience, but it's like you must be a dream to fight with [01:01:24] Well, I'm human [01:01:27] People out there that would [01:01:30] Well, we can get into this but projection is a very interesting thing that happens in arguments too [01:01:34] People can actually throw their anger into other people's nervous systems, which is amazing. Oh, yeah [01:01:40] Never done it. Don't know what you're talking about a really powerful tool [01:01:44] So the body's engaged the moment the body's engaged and the moment you feel agitation [01:01:50] It's because the generic chemicals are designed to move you the stress response was designed to get you to either [01:01:56] Stay put move away or move forward. So it's either stay put retreat or fight. There's really no other right fourth option [01:02:03] So the moment anyone out there feels that agitat\", \" out there feels that agitation they have to recognize that their body's been hijacked [01:02:09] We talked about the brain being hijacked your body has a great way to put it [01:02:13] So I always say it's hard to control the mind with the mind you can do it in your calmer states [01:02:18] But it's very hard to control the mind with your mind when you've been activated. So the moment you feel agitation in your body I [01:02:25] Recommend looking to behavior control your body to then get control of the mind because they're it's bi-directional [01:02:31] Brain controls body body controls brain. That's why I suggest things like the physiological sigh or panoramic vision [01:02:37] Things like that because the worst thing you can tell yourself or somebody who's stressed is calm down. No, that's worse [01:02:44] Right or forget about it on a fire or even take a deep breath [01:02:48] Which is actually the will have the opposite effect on your nervous system. It'll tend to ramp your alertness up even more [01:02:53] Yeah, and don't say to your girl after listening to this take two deep breaths [01:03:01] If he does that or if she does that you are free to in\", \"does that you are free to introduce the eye roll [01:03:09] So [01:03:10] That's why I like panoramic vision. It's completely covert [01:03:13] So you can for people out there who want to learn how to remain calm in stressful situations [01:03:17] Panoramic vision is very powerful and in addition to that for the which means going outside and looking at a horizon [01:03:23] We're doing it right now. Let's say I say something that triggers you you can look at me [01:03:26] But you can see what's going on in the corner of the room [01:03:28] Just look to look to the corner and your vision just stop looking at you. They said look that look. I'm still in the picture [01:03:35] Delete you but delete right but it start to include the full room [01:03:38] See if you can see yourself in this environment, even though we're not outside [01:03:41] Can you now do that and then can you narrow your focus? [01:03:44] Wait, what's happened? So you can contract or dilate your eye contact makes me very nervous [01:03:49] So I'm now like so you should do it all at I just like went offline because you're looking in my eyes [01:03:53] No, okay panic because you know what I ne\", \"c because you know what I never [01:03:55] Oh, yeah, your pupils. No, I'm [01:04:00] That's for earlier, but I was told this is a and the and the fact that I have not gotten into nurture yet is [01:04:08] Really illustrates my respect and love for you because I want so badly to get into the nurture part of this conversation because [01:04:16] Isn't it the amount of eye contact you get in the first couple years of your life? [01:04:19] Like I just [01:04:20] Is so important in terms of your ability to make eye contact later in life. I just struggled for eye contact to [01:04:27] See, I'm getting nervous. I'm [01:04:29] For the longest time eye contact makes me very uneasy. It's gotten better in the last couple years [01:04:34] But when I first started everybody said that I looked like at the side of their ear when I talked to them [01:04:39] Do you ever like talk to people and that you think they're looking at your hairline or looking at your teeth? [01:04:43] What you're doing is a really good example of exteroception [01:04:46] You're you're paying attention to what they're doing as you know [01:04:49] There are people that seem to look like I'm looking\", \"eem to look like I'm looking at you. Uh, yeah, your eyes are [01:04:53] Okay, a lot of people are like you don't ophthalmology speak. We'd say you're foveated towards me. Yeah, that's right [01:04:58] But we're both so afraid of interrupting each other [01:05:01] I want to because on this podcast we talk so much about nurture and something that they in I've [01:05:07] learned a lot of an addiction [01:05:09] um [01:05:10] educating myself an addiction is something that we say a lot is [01:05:13] Uh genetics loads the gun environment pulls the trigger [01:05:16] Does that fair to say or is that just sound good for many things? I think that's true [01:05:22] Look everybody knows that I am a gourmet chef. I [01:05:28] I'm just to update her wikipedia now. I'm a whiz in the kitchen. I am a culinary artist [01:05:36] I am [01:05:39] A magician I [01:05:41] I am a magician quite frankly when it comes to [01:05:45] To say bread and then I'm saying flour and I said friend [01:05:49] Your magician has then watched this I'll deliver. I'll get it delivered [01:05:52] But I can't cook all day. I want to and I can [01:05:57] Very well quite frankly [01:06:00] intimid\", \"e frankly [01:06:00] intimidatingly well [01:06:02] But door dash [01:06:05] I prefer oh me door dash is my best friend. Well, I don't want to cook all the time because like I don't want to make anyone [01:06:10] Feel bad, you know you live alone, right? I don't want to make them [01:06:14] So no, I don't I live with a couple imaginary friends and two ghosts [01:06:19] Door dash. I'm obsessed with door dash. I use it constantly brings food [01:06:24] You're craving right now right to your door safely. They will leave it outside [01:06:30] They won't even talk to you which is my favorite thing [01:06:33] But they will well, if you have a problem [01:06:35] They'll fix it. They'll be like we agree and they'll fix it right away like what like say you have an issue [01:06:40] And you're like, you know what I ordered 18 wings and you only sent me [01:06:43] Seven sometimes I want to talk and if you want to because you're lonely not me [01:06:48] But the people who are they will chat with you. They'll remember you and they come back [01:06:52] There's one guy that has a that I met a door dash guy [01:06:55] And he met my dogs and I was like do you have any dog\", \"was like do you have any dogs and he was like stop talking to me [01:06:59] You sad lady and he showed me his blue german shepherd [01:07:04] He has a german shepherd that's gray. Well, we call it blue and he lives here now [01:07:10] We're together. Door dash is actually a dating app [01:07:15] 300,000 [01:07:17] Partners in the u.s. Puerto Rico, canada and australia you can support your local go-tos [01:07:22] Which is really important right now in the pandemic support your local restaurants choose from your favorite national restaurants as well [01:07:28] Like chipotle love it [01:07:31] Some of the best dates i've ever gone on were at chipotle wendy's [01:07:35] Wendy's oh, yeah get them nuggets right to your door [01:07:38] And uh, okay, sorry my dog is freaking out because i'm talking about door dash [01:07:41] He knows that when I talk about door dash that means there's going to be some food on the way [01:07:45] The cheesecake factory get yourselves to treat yourself. We're in a pandemic order a cheesecake from door dash [01:07:52] That's called self-care contact the delivery. It's always safe. We said that already. I know I just want to make sur\", \"know I just want to make sure that's very important [01:07:58] Okay, right now our listeners can get five dollars off their first order of 15 dollars or more [01:08:03] Zero delivery fees for their first month when you download the door dash app and enter what code wittney [01:08:09] And that's a big deal no delivery fees for a month. Did you just point at me? Yeah, I did [01:08:14] Was that an air gun? I wanted you to get that you get that point across [01:08:18] Five dollars off your first order of cheesecake [01:08:21] Hopefully and zero delivery fees for a month when you download the door dash app in the app store [01:08:27] And enter the code wittney don't forget that's code wittney for five dollars off your first order with door dash [01:08:34] Benton [01:08:35] Whitney I'm going to tell you something that you're not going to believe [01:08:39] No one's going to believe it people are going to accuse me of being a liar [01:08:42] It says that you go to therapy [01:08:47] Sometimes I stink oh [01:08:50] I know it's hard to believe. I know it is tough to believe [01:08:53] You have all people believe it or not. I sweat like a pig [01:08:57] Because I \", \" a pig [01:08:57] Because I don't even sweat [01:08:59] You know what I mean [01:09:01] And I did not wear deodorant for the longest time because it deodorant is chock full of chemicals [01:09:07] Oh, yeah bad stuff like like aluminum [01:09:10] And talc talcum bad. Yeah very bad. And what it's not the full name not talcum talcum go to your room [01:09:20] Because what it does is it aluminum clogs your pores and actually stops you from sweating [01:09:24] And then sweat comes out other and then your body absorbs the aluminum into it [01:09:28] But then it's like then you start sweating other places like your crevices get swampy [01:09:32] And it's like it's like your sweating becomes like whack them out other places start putting your deodorant other places [01:09:37] It's really hard. So the point is I never wore deodorant until I discovered native native. I've been a long time user of [01:09:43] I see I didn't know that which is why I never stink. How am I just finding out about native deodorant. It's amazing. I use the [01:09:49] Um, uh coconut vanilla one smells so good. I I do lavender and rose because I'm a lady [01:09:56] I'm a Parisian queen [01:\", \"6] I'm a Parisian queen [01:09:57] Okay, but it's made out of coconut oil shea butter tapioca starch. It's vegan never tested on animals [01:10:04] Which is why we love love love love love them [01:10:08] Native will keep you smelling fresh all day long. You have no excuse to stink you guys. Let's just get to it [01:10:14] It's nothing ruins a situation more than smelling someone's body odor [01:10:17] It's rude. It's tacky. It's unacceptable. It's inappropriate. Yeah, I don't like this whole like well [01:10:23] I don't wear deodorant because you know my body. Well, I can smell your body hanging out with that's a bit [01:10:28] Oh, that's a thing also like we're wearing masks and we're six feet apart [01:10:32] If I can still smell you pull it together [01:10:34] Native deodorant risk-free every product comes with free shipping in the u.s.

Yeah, but they love this. I know [01:10:52] Sometimes guys when you're like making out with a guy and they like get near your armpit [01:10:56\", \"t near your armpit [01:10:56] You're like, oh no, and they're like, whoa, like what guy's getting under your armpit [01:11:01] I'm just saying guys sometimes like there's a fear response to hide like what are you talking about? [01:11:08] I'm just saying you trust me trust me. There's a deodorant [01:11:11] You know when guys crawl into your armpits for safety? This deodorant overly I'm just telling you [01:11:17] I've had some bad experiences in the past with sketchy deodorants and guys mouths and I've not had that problem with native [01:11:25] What are you talking about? [01:11:27] I just trust me you girls know what I'm talking about girls [01:11:32] You girls know when your boyfriend eats off all your deodorant and makes that with you [01:11:36] Freaks they're freaks girls. I'm just telling you it's I'm just [01:11:41] Well, I don't know that native is edible, but anyways [01:11:45] Make a switch to native today by going to nativedo.com slash whitney or use promo code whitney at checkout and get 20 off your first order [01:11:54] That's native deo.com.

They're just calm from day one [01:12:43] They're like the bulldogs of the world. You can't shock them [01:12:46] But it does any of that have to do with what happened [01:12:49] Uh to the neurochemicals of the mother while they were in utero could be but I think there's a significant amount of hard wiring [01:12:55] There are genetic programs that come from mom and dad [0\", \"hat come from mom and dad [01:12:59] That make sure that there's a nervous system that's a rough template [01:13:02] Or map of what that child might expect in life [01:13:07] Then you have neural plasticity which allows the brain to be customized according to experience [01:13:11] And we know this because of twin studies two identical twins [01:13:14] In the same sack inside which is important [01:13:16] They call it monochorionic meaning in the same sack or dichorionic [01:13:20] There's a little boundary between those two babies. They can actually have [01:13:23] Very different nervous systems compared to if they are in the same sack if they're identical twins [01:13:27] Yeah, even so yeah, there's all this stuff about twin concordance. It's called [01:13:32] So there are biases and then that kid shows up in the world [01:13:37] And it's interesting to think about the relationship between nature and nurture because let's say that that kid has a genetic bias to be more calm [01:13:44] And to explore her his environment in a more calm way [01:13:47] Well, then they're going to learn things differently and maybe become even more calm, right? So it's right\", \"e calm, right? So it's right [01:13:51] It's it's what we call a mobius strip. It's there. You can't separate it at any one point [01:13:56] Now there is clearly a strong role for nurturing and experience [01:14:01] But the genetic component is something that you know, a lot of people are uncomfortable with because we love this idea [01:14:06] of a tablo rasa of a blank slate and you can just write your entire [01:14:11] Neurology yourself or depending on where you're raised, but there are these genetic biases [01:14:16] Some of them like perfect pitch for some people have perfect pitch [01:14:20] Yeah, they know when a note is is is off or something other people seem to be tone deaf [01:14:25] Right something about the bones in your ears could be something at the at the periphery [01:14:30] What we do know is every human assuming there isn't some developmental defect [01:14:34] Comes into the world with the same sensors the same sensors in the eye [01:14:38] A colorblind person might be missing one, but the same sensors in the eye the same touch sensors in the skin [01:14:44] Since you mentioned weight blankets, I'll just use this as an opportunity to t\", \" this as an opportunity to try and answer your question [01:14:48] Even though it's off topic. It's a relevant tangent [01:14:51] There are sensors in all of our skin that respond to light touch [01:14:56] There are sensors that respond to firm touch [01:14:58] Believe it or not little little things that fire different electric signals to the brain saying that's too tough [01:15:03] That's nice and you know gentle or that feels weird or that handshake feels creepy [01:15:09] That's big or tickle or cold or pain all of those are in everybody [01:15:14] And the the feeling of distributed weight across big surfaces of our body [01:15:20] Does connect to a neural pathway that promotes calm [01:15:24] So it makes sense to me that a weight blanket would be used to calm that would have a calming effect [01:15:30] Right like when I am stressed out. I put my great day in pit bull on my chest [01:15:34] And I'm sure it has something to do with him, but it's also just like the weights [01:15:38] Make me feel so much better and holding a pillow here is a common practice [01:15:42] Well, the reason is that we have an abundance of the receptors that I'm referring to h\", \"tors that I'm referring to here on our chest [01:15:47] So weighted blankets work [01:15:49] Weighted if you like pressure. Yeah weighted blankets work for a logical reason related to the sensors in our skin [01:15:55] That's different than a hug [01:15:57] Hug is you get oxytocin from right? That's different oxytocin is this right the chemical hormone that's released that tells you [01:16:05] You're safe. It tells you there's somebody there that would [01:16:08] Protect you that there's somebody there that's that's [01:16:11] On your side unless the hug's a little too long [01:16:14] Unless the hug's a little too long and then there's then there's another molecule, which I'm guessing that [01:16:20] Well, you probably know about it, but it's called tachykinin [01:16:22] It's a peptide that's released when we don't get enough social or physical contact with other people [01:16:28] This is discovery of a guy named david anderson's laboratory here at caltech's phenomenal researcher and tachykinin [01:16:34] Is released in our bodies when we haven't had enough human contact, which we're probably all going through right now [01:16:39] And it increases fear [\", \":39] And it increases fear [01:16:41] Threshold to fear and aggression [01:16:44] So it's that kind of a greg not not the kind of what's happening with all of us in quarantine and not being able to [01:16:48] Socialize well tachykinin release is that why cancel culture started tachykinin to we have that to blame [01:16:54] And we could blame everyone's just like we need to cancel tachykinin [01:16:57] Yes, we do. I'm just saying everyone will I get in trouble for canceling saying that [01:17:02] I don't know who's who owns the patent on tachy. No, everyone makes tachykinin mice make it dogs make it [01:17:07] Because we are not designed to be solitary [01:17:09] We are designed to have a certain amount of eye contact today a certain amount of physical touch a day [01:17:12] And we are also isolated now also just in general like the the solo [01:17:17] The departure from tribal villages to now just everyone living in apartments alone and [01:17:22] Doesn't that tell us on a like subconscious primordial level? [01:17:25] Like we've been ousted from the tribe or don't have protection from the tribe or something [01:17:29] Yeah, these chemical systems earlie\", \"hese chemical systems earlier [01:17:31] We're talking about adrenaline and norepinephrine and all these things that make us activated [01:17:35] The other chemical system, which is the one that we're talking about now [01:17:37] I mean, there are several is serotonin and oxytocin. Those are the things that are released with [01:17:42] Thoughts of gratitude social connection physical touch, which is why just saying I mean a big part of 12-step programs [01:17:48] I'm going to keep bringing this up because there's so much [01:17:52] Scientific proof of why a lot of this stuff kind of like works like one of the biggest tools is a gratitude list [01:17:57] If you're in a bad place [01:17:57] You just start right down writing down things you're grateful for and it seems corny and it seems annoying [01:18:02] And it seems stupid and I hate doing it [01:18:04] But there is a neurological basis for why it works [01:18:06] Absolutely gratitude is not complacency and I do some work with people in special operations military [01:18:11] You'd be surprised how many like truly high performers in high-risk high consequence jobs use gratitude practices to reset themsel\", \"e practices to reset themselves [01:18:19] To be able to lean back into high stress high exertion type things. So the the way to think about biology and neuroscience is that [01:18:26] It uses very few ingredients to cook up everybody's experience [01:18:30] And so everyone we're all very attached to our own life experience because it's unique [01:18:35] It's unique to us our parents our upbringing where we're at where we're going what we want what we want to avoid [01:18:40] But the chemicals are all the same [01:18:42] You use dopamine to feel a sense of elation and reward and dopamine is really the molecule of desire of wanting to pursue things [01:18:49] And you use serotonin and oxytocin [01:18:52] Anytime you feel like you have enough you're safe whatever that comes from the weighted blanket dogs close to social connections, whatever that is [01:19:00] I use the exact same chemicals, but I'm wired so that slightly different things [01:19:06] Release those chemicals, but a lot of the same things all human beings were wired such that serotonin and oxytocin [01:19:12] Are released in response to to nurturing physical touch and connection [01:19:17] Ye\", \"and connection [01:19:17] Yeah, and tachykinin is released when we don't get enough of it. That's a non-negotiable aspect of our biology [01:19:23] So I don't care how tough somebody is or how weak somebody is, you know to use, you know, coarse language [01:19:30] In the end it's the same chemicals that are cooking these things up [01:19:33] And what's important to understand about the way these chemicals work is that they're controlled [01:19:39] Subjectively like it's not like you touch somebody and they kind of well, maybe they like dribble a little serotonin in your ear [01:19:43] That's where you're like drill serotonin in your ear [01:19:45] But but it's all internal serotonin is released from this area called the raffae nucleus in the brain stem like it's [01:19:52] They uh acetylcholin is released from the nucleus basallis. It's not like everyone does it differently [01:19:57] Everyone's doing this stuff the same way. It's like they're all kept in the same locations on everybody's cooking a shelf in the kitchen [01:20:04] Right until I do a lot of cooking [01:20:06] It's like babies cooking. I'm not very domestic [01:20:10] I'm not very domestic,\", \"0:10] I'm not very domestic, but I think that your brain. It's like I'm just listening to you speak and like literally latin [01:20:15] I think that just like your hippocampus is full of those words [01:20:18] So there's no space for basic things like a cabinet. It's bad. I grew up in this [01:20:22] I got in this neuroscience thing really young [01:20:24] And I like that you don't know basic words of like shelf and refrigerator, but you know, you know, I've heard of shelf and refrigerator [01:20:33] But but when I think refrigerator you say that and I think of a lab refrigerator [01:20:36] Yeah, that's so dark and sad [01:20:39] I like that you just don't know basic there are there are people that would agree to you [01:20:42] What would you call this distilled water? [01:20:45] Bottle non-ionized water [01:20:48] Just water [01:20:49] Sorry if I'm using too much. No, no, I love it. The point is that they're gonna keep [01:20:53] dubbing it down [01:20:54] You know, we think to use an analogy like proteins fats and carbohydrates. Everyone's probably heard of those [01:20:59] Those are, you know, the macronutrients that make up all foods [01:21:03] Some \", \"p all foods [01:21:03] Some foods have more than others of each of those, of course different emotional states different states of feeling good or afraid [01:21:11] serotonin oxytocin [01:21:13] Acetylcholine dopamine those are the macronutrients of our experiences, right? [01:21:19] Right, and I want to sort of talk about these these serotonin and dopamine all these things that [01:21:25] These neurochemicals that kind of drive our choices that drive what feels good what feels comfortable and [01:21:33] You know humans are so [01:21:35] Paradoxal and complicated in this area because I like to break down. Why is my friend staying in this bad relationship? [01:21:41] Why is this guy dating this girl who he thinks is psycho and crazy and etc? [01:21:45] Right. So a lot of times things that are ostensibly bad feel [01:21:50] Good, right? We tend to recreate our childhood circumstances if we don't intervene in some way and actively try to course correct it [01:21:56] We almost subconsciously try to find that [01:22:00] Warm hug of dysfunction that whatever neurochemical cocktail was omitted [01:22:05] You know, I'm very comfortable in a time of crisis and ch\", \"e in a time of crisis and chaos and it makes people in my life very confused [01:22:12] I am calm in a time of crisis and when things are calm. I am always waiting for the other shoe to drop [01:22:17] I get anxious when things aren't going wrong. I feel like there's a damocles sword hanging and [01:22:21] Things are about to go wrong, you know, so that I believe is from my nurture [01:22:28] Harville Hendricks talks about how we're attracted to people who have the negative qualities of our primary caretakers [01:22:33] And I'm just curious about like the neurological [01:22:36] Perspective on that are we sort of subconsciously seeking whatever combination of adrenaline cortisol serotonin dopamine that we [01:22:42] Got as kids [01:22:43] You know, are we kind of zombies to that when you see people who can't stop dating? [01:22:47] Crazy people people that make them feel bad people that make them feel jealous [01:22:51] Are they just recreating that mixture of whatever their mom and dad [01:22:54] Created yeah, those are great questions. So um, I'll approach them in sequence [01:22:59] The first one is this thing about you being calm in stressful situati\", \"ng calm in stressful situations [01:23:03] I think that could there's a neuroscience lens and interpretation on on that is that it could reflect the fact that internally [01:23:10] You seem to be pretty high energy like that metronome tends to be more like tick tick tick than like tick [01:23:16] Tick we know people that it's like come on like you can't engage them [01:23:20] So when the world matches your internal processing speed and that match of what's going on inside and outside [01:23:27] Are both kind of high speed. It's gonna feel aligned. It's gonna feel right [01:23:32] Okay [01:23:33] Otherwise it might seem like the world is passing by a little too slowly for you, right because you're high functioning [01:23:39] This is what we call like high functioning. It's a reflection of having a really well-developed forebrain [01:23:44] Which is an asset. You can make plans. You can be creative work. I mean, let's let's [01:23:48] But then you end up over committing yourself and exhausting yourself and being less [01:23:51] Functioning if you don't have some kind of moderation, right? It needs to be bounded [01:23:54] But it's not I wouldn't see it as \", \"'s not I wouldn't see it as a detriment, but it means that [01:23:59] Too much placidity and calm is going to feel kind of stressful [01:24:03] Because there's that mismatch makes me anxious and for people that are very low energy [01:24:06] Me on a vacation is a nightmare. I've got my clipboard. I'm like, we're doing this. We're going to see whale sharks [01:24:10] We're going to do this. Yeah, and for some people that are really exhausted or burnt out [01:24:14] Whatever that is or they're kind of low energy [01:24:17] The world is going to seem like it's going by really fast. That's kind of oppressive [01:24:21] Right, and I think people are just wired differently and the reason I bring up dogs [01:24:24] Is not just because you like dogs and I like dogs, but because you look at the different dog breeds [01:24:29] And they are selected for this what we call autonomic baseline this temperament [01:24:34] That the straightforward way of saying is you meet my bulldog Costello and it's like [01:24:38] It takes a lot to activate him the whole world must seem like it's going by a million miles an hour to that guy [01:24:43] They are bred to do different thi\", \"are bred to do different things. That's right now [01:24:44] I'm really understanding this metaphor in a in a real way before I was pretending [01:24:48] I understood it now I actually understand it because when people [01:24:51] I do a lot of dog rescue and when people are like, oh my god, I want to get this husky [01:24:54] I'm like if you get this husky is bred to work [01:24:57] It needs two hours a day [01:24:59] Of exercise go crazy not negotiable doesn't matter. What kind of nurture [01:25:03] It doesn't it does not matter. This is just how this thing is wired [01:25:06] Um, uh, australian shepherds everyone wants an australian shepherd now [01:25:09] And then they get what's the the ones with no tail. They're herding dogs [01:25:13] Right and that's the only way they can experience the world is they get very anxious if they can't organize things [01:25:18] They get very they get an australian shepherd sitting right here would be very anxious about the layout of this podcast studio [01:25:23] because everyone needs to get herded together and [01:25:26] The dog will constantly be going in circles trying to get us all in a group [01:25:29] They hear\", \"a group [01:25:29] They heard and that's the only way that they can experience the world [01:25:33] And apartment living with a couple [01:25:36] Someone's in the bedroom. Someone's in the living room really stresses them out [01:25:39] Some people and some a lot of dogs their temperament is calm other breeds are bred for [01:25:44] An alertness and an awareness of their environment. It was they were selected for that [01:25:48] So this this is a I would say is probably the best example [01:25:51] I can give for the nature nurture thing those dogs come in bulldogs come into the world [01:25:56] Kind of function a little bit slower than a whip it right right nothing against the bulldogs [01:26:01] I own a bulldog. I love them, but they're bred for different things the bulldog [01:26:04] You know how intense dog people are. Yeah, yeah, you criticize a breed [01:26:09] If you want to understand I will say if you want to understand [01:26:12] Neuroscience and the relationship between nature nurture spend time with animals [01:26:17] Yes, because you'll see different temperaments and spend time with a lot of different species [01:26:21] Spend time with grazin\", \"6:21] Spend time with grazing animals [01:26:23] Watch the eyes of a of a lion that lays around during the day [01:26:26] And then when it hunts its eyes what the pupils dilate it bring it literally eyes move forward in the head [01:26:32] You're looking at the brain the eyes [01:26:34] Changing in response to level of alertness. That's us when we're in stress. Yeah, so you see it in animals best [01:26:40] We are animals, but what you described [01:26:43] This alertness and this ability to make plans and anticipate things and bring in a lot of memory [01:26:48] That is the those are the the basic components of creative and great works [01:26:52] And I think it's no no coincidence that you're a creative in addition to other things [01:26:57] That's you know, your job is based on creating new novel things. That's what humans are good at [01:27:01] Taking existing elements reorganizing them and creating new things. That's what we do [01:27:06] And the the forebrain is designed for that and it feels like agitation or stress [01:27:11] But that's also what allowed us to become who we are. Well, that's the thing [01:27:13] I uh, we always joke that I always s\", \" always joke that I always say there's a war on on something [01:27:17] There's a war on stress and there's a war on anxiety and I'm you know for me [01:27:21] I think because I've spent so much of my life ignoring my intuition and ignoring my [01:27:26] gut [01:27:27] And for me sometimes fear and anxiety are synonymous with that of this like I have a bad feeling about this person [01:27:33] I have a bad feeling about this situation [01:27:34] But you know I'm going to do it anyway because I think a lot of you know, especially [01:27:38] You know [01:27:39] Women have been programmed to calm down relax or over sensitive [01:27:41] You're overthinking it where guys have been programmed to you're being a pussy man up [01:27:46] You know, so we have this sort of programming that has I think in a big way conditioned us [01:27:51] to minimize and oftentimes ignore [01:27:55] Fear and anxiety and so now when I see so much conversation about getting rid of fear and anxiety and I'm like [01:28:00] To me those are my guardian angels and I now [01:28:03] I'm [01:28:04] Very grateful for my ability to feel my fear and anxiety and I try to listen to it [01:28:07] B\", \"to listen to it [01:28:07] But I think the hardest part is delineating. What's rational? What's irrational? [01:28:11] What's helpful fear and anxiety and what's paralyzing fear and anxiety? How do you know the difference? [01:28:16] Well, it's same chemicals always going to be a double-edged sword [01:28:19] Remember neuroplasticity is good. Neuroplasticity is bad. It it wires in traumas. It's what allows you to unwire traumas. You asked about couples and [01:28:27] Um destructive patterns or people who are in destructive patterns of relating because I'm gonna be on [01:28:31] I'm gonna be fair out of something when my guy friends like I'm taking this grocery to fucking psycho [01:28:34] I'm like you love it [01:28:35] You love it and you know you love it because it's unpredictable and it's surprising [01:28:39] And you're getting all this dopamine from the fact that you never know where she is and she cheated on you or whatever [01:28:43] Right, you know their dopamine is wired for [01:28:47] Well, let me try and explain this [01:28:50] From a slightly different perspective. So [01:28:52] He's not the favorite of most people [01:28:55] But I'm a big fa\", \" [01:28:55] But I'm a big fan. So Freud had a word for what you describe. It's called the repetition compulsion [01:29:01] So Freud's assessment was that when we experience something traumatic [01:29:06] Early in childhood or anytime in childhood that we recreate patterns that will bring us back into that experience [01:29:14] As a way to try and solve that to to [01:29:18] React to it differently because you know, it is true that uh, you know a 25 year old will react very differently to this [01:29:24] The same traumatic experience relived as a 25 year old than a five year old [01:29:29] Right, they just have a capacity that a five year old doesn't have that was Freud's assessment. What's [01:29:33] True neurobiologically what we can say for sure neurobiologically is that the brain circuits the connections in the brain and the brain areas [01:29:40] That are responsible for infant parent attachment [01:29:44] Are not discarded when we hit age 25. It's not like, oh, I don't need my mom and my dad anymore [01:29:49] So I'm going to just get rid of that brain area [01:29:53] Those brain areas are used for attachment in romantic relationships [01:29:57] Now\", \"relationships [01:29:57] Now that gets a little eerie to people because they're like, oh, it sounds very edible electro complex, right? [01:30:02] No, but you really think you throw away real estate and the brain like, oh, don't need that anymore [01:30:06] That's not like the kid's toy room that then you graduate to college and you go off to a dorm [01:30:10] Doesn't work that way that neural real estate is reused. So so are we just trying to uh [01:30:16] Pattern recognition are we trying to recreate patterns or find comfortable patterns of like, you know [01:30:21] I used to do this joke about like every time we meet someone we're like mama dad dad [01:30:24] Like I mean just all the time. Are you my mother when you're dating? Yeah [01:30:27] I think there are elements of that. I mean some people react to their upbringing by looking for people [01:30:32] Are the exact opposite, right [01:30:35] so [01:30:36] I'm going to use a an example that at first might seem a little odd and this isn't [01:30:40] I want to be really clear is not an attempt to bring things into um, a kind of salacious or uh, more sexual discussion [01:30:46] But there I want to tal\", \":46] But there I want to talk you're in the right place if you [01:30:49] Well, I I want to talk about from the bio biological standpoint. I'm just trying to not get you fired [01:30:53] I'm trying to restrain myself. Well, I mean I I'm happy to talk about the biology as as we understand it. I'm and I'm [01:30:59] You know, I don't know everything so I'm gonna make mistakes as I as I talk I I do hope I don't [01:31:04] I'll fill in any blanks that you don't know [01:31:06] Let's talk about some biological hard wiring as it relates to mate choice [01:31:09] Let's pick the most let's pick the one that everyone agrees on. Can I can I [01:31:15] Uh, can you quiz me? [01:31:17] Uh, sure, although. I'm not sure you want me to quiz you on this one [01:31:20] Because what I'm about to see the most important thing. What's the most important thing in terms of mate choice [01:31:25] Is this a trick question? No smell [01:31:29] It's pretty good. You're impressed admit it smell might play a role in it [01:31:33] But what's what's mother nature's punishment mother nature punishes this behavior very severely mother nature punishes this behavior very severely [01:31:45\", \"vior very severely [01:31:45] Incest [01:31:47] Yes, which is why when someone smells bad, it means you're related to them in some way, right? [01:31:50] So since you threw that out there if you give a hundred mice [01:31:54] My producers are just [01:31:57] So if you give [01:31:59] Your gap is unbelievable. So well, I'm I'm trying to I just want to make sure that I close whatever [01:32:05] Hatches we open and and um, but you know [01:32:17] Am I blowing your mind? [01:32:19] All right, I'm starting to learn where you get your dopamine hits [01:32:27] um [01:32:28] So incest is not [01:32:30] Good everyone everyone agrees that incest is bad and there's a biological penalty for [01:32:37] Incest that leads to offspring right leads to mutations that are less vigorous [01:32:42] Yes mating with close of kin in any animal [01:32:45] But in particular in humans is very bad for the offspring, right? [01:32:50] So there's that means that that's the most hardwired example I can give of badmate choice [01:32:55] Right, that literally means that there's a punishment for mating with close of kin. Mm-hmm. You have to talk to them [01:33:02] Yeah, I don't even know\", \":02] Yeah, I don't even know how to process that so that means there's a genetic there's a genetic penalty. Yeah, okay [01:33:10] If you give a hundred mice [01:33:12] choice of [01:33:13] Sorry, you give one mouse a choice of a hundred mice as a mate. Uh-huh opposite sex mate [01:33:20] They will pick the one that has the immune composition [01:33:23] That is furthest from their own without realizing why they do it because from smell. It's from smell [01:33:30] Okay, it's through what I call pheromones. So hormones are things that are secreted in our body act on other tissues in our body [01:33:35] pheromones are things that are secreted by one member of a species act on other members of a species [01:33:40] Or it can be a cross species, but generally so pay attention to what someone smells like [01:33:44] Well, some of these studies have been controversial and this [01:33:49] But there are some solid data that show that if [01:33:52] Women in particular if they are given say 50 t-shirts to smell [01:33:56] Yeah, and all of these have been washed in the same [01:33:59] Washer with soap and all that stuff they can pick out their [01:34:04] significant ot\", \"ir [01:34:04] significant others shirt with a high degree of [01:34:08] Specificity meaning much better than chance. Okay, so that's pheromones in action [01:34:13] Synchronization of menstrual cycles amongst women that are group housed sounds like animals, but group, you know what I mean [01:34:19] There's some data now that say that might not be a strong effect as as once was thought [01:34:23] But most women will tell you it's a pretty strong effect. Okay, things like that. So [01:34:29] Mate choice [01:34:30] On the extreme is like incest is bad. All right, then you think, okay [01:34:34] Well, what makes somebody pick somebody that's not good for them psychologically, right? [01:34:39] So then you have to look to something that's probably more rooted in developmental upbringing [01:34:44] And the question is are they template matching? Are they matching the oh, you know [01:34:48] I had a dad that raged and so I like men who are very aggressive and then they end up in an abusive relationship [01:34:54] Or because I because this just create it's just a comfortable [01:34:58] Uh [01:34:59] Sort of equilibrium of neurochemicals. That's just I I think i\", \"als. That's just I I think it boils down to [01:35:04] So we have to ask ourselves. What are the chemicals and hormones of sexual attraction and those tend to be [01:35:11] dopamine and testosterone in men [01:35:13] And dopamine and estrogen in women people think that estrogen is the opposite of testosterone [01:35:19] But actually prolactin is the opposite of testosterone and estrogen in terms of its brain effects. We can get into this but [01:35:27] so [01:35:28] People are attracted to certain people because of this release of this neurochemical dopamine which makes them excited [01:35:33] It's it is the the molecule of desire [01:35:35] It's closely tethered to estrogen in women and to testosterone does adrenaline turn into dopamine [01:35:40] No, but adrenaline can so this is interesting [01:35:43] So for some people high levels of adrenaline [01:35:46] Activate the dopamine and testosterone response and testosterone in both men and women is responsible for libido and sort of attraction [01:35:53] So someone that for some people someone that causes you stress right could then give you dopamine. Absolutely [01:35:57] So let's just let's create a wha\", \"et's just let's create a what Einstein would have called a gedonkin experiment was just in our minds [01:36:02] This is not a laboratory experiment, but in line with this hypothesis. Somebody grows up in a household where there's a lot of [01:36:10] aggressive behavior [01:36:12] And they swear they're never going to involve with somebody who has that like hair trigger kind of aggressive behavior [01:36:17] Then you they find themselves and their friends find that person in a relationship with somebody who has that kind of behavior [01:36:22] And they feel like it's a turn on that they're attracted to that person [01:36:26] It might not even be sexual excitement, but it's [01:36:29] They're drawn to that person drawn. It could be that adrenaline that whole circuit for adrenaline has been wired to [01:36:37] recruit things like dopamine and the sexual response [01:36:42] When they experience that kind of heightened level of activation [01:36:45] They're pretty good data showing that [01:36:47] Adrenaline can trigger testosterone as long as it's not too much if there's too much adrenaline [01:36:53] Then testosterone is is suppressed and makes cortisol. We\", \"essed and makes cortisol. We make cortisol instead rather [01:36:58] So you could imagine that people repeat these patterns is what Freud would have called the repetition compulsion on the basis of some early template [01:37:06] That was learned [01:37:08] Not as hardwired as incest, which is absolutely [01:37:12] Categorically without question bad at a biological level, right? I think almost everyone would agree that right and the ones that [01:37:19] Wouldn't are the ones we got to be concerned about right, right? So [01:37:23] Then sorry, but so when people say they like crazy like they go, oh, you know, he's crazy [01:37:28] Or pretend they don't people that are attracted to drama that are always with you know in some kind of chaos [01:37:33] We all know those people right and maybe and that largely [01:37:37] Presumably reflects an internal chaos that they're trying to pattern match with [01:37:41] Or their life is dull and it's the one thing that takes them out of their life of dullness [01:37:46] I don't know. I'm not a psychologist [01:37:47] So I can't speculate on that but the neurochemicals of attraction and desire are very simple [01:37:53] I\", \"are very simple [01:37:53] It's dopamine we think of dopamine as the reward people always say like sex triggers dopamine or money triggers dopamine. It's not [01:38:00] It's not so much having sex or acquiring money. It's the pursuit of sex or money. That's right. It's it's the gambler [01:38:07] It's the person who's going to get high [01:38:10] This is where these and now we're talking about it in a dark way [01:38:12] But I want to be clear the dopamine system is one of the reasons why we [01:38:16] Evolved to leave the territories we were raised in and go find new territories to build businesses [01:38:23] to seek healthy relationships to [01:38:25] Seek degrees or careers. I mean it is the molecule of pursuit of anything that lies outside the boundaries of our skin motivation [01:38:32] Low dopamine low motivation low dopamine a hedonia sadness [01:38:37] serotonin [01:38:38] Is the feel good with what you've got and when you look at drugs of abuse [01:38:42] You start to see these in their extreme somebody on cocaine is all about pursuit of something [01:38:46] Right, especially cocaine and amphetamine and if you see people who are cocaine and ster\", \"ple who are cocaine and steroids [01:38:51] You're talking testosterone and dopamine. It's all pursuit pursuit pursuit of me cocaine addicts love me [01:38:57] I don't know if it's a hair. I don't know what it is [01:39:00] I don't have a I just don't have a scientific explanation for it. So I just gonna say you have a strong data point [01:39:05] Is there something about me that makes addicts love me explain? [01:39:09] They are associating you with the dopamine experience with their mom [01:39:15] I'm their drunk mom [01:39:17] The serotonin if you think about drugs like marijuana or the opioid system [01:39:20] Those tend to make people pretty happy to just sit there and do nothing. Yeah, right now [01:39:24] I realize there are there are [01:39:26] Some people that because marijuana is legal in california that the cannabis crew comes after me with pitchforks although very slowly [01:39:34] So what I want to say is I mean there are I'm talking about extremes here [01:39:38] I'm talking about abuse of chemicals um in all cases [01:39:41] But the serotonin system tends to make people pretty quiescent [01:39:45] And so and I know couples that are both bo\", \"now couples that are both both very placid and they seem so happy together, right? [01:39:50] Yeah, they're not they somehow they've created a bubble where the whole reward system is within that bubble [01:39:56] They're secretly in an open relationship or they're bringing tea to each other. Yeah, there's they're wearing horse masks or something [01:40:03] I mean you see this stuff all over social media the memes that you see [01:40:07] Or the pictures of couples together the sunsets all that you can think of those as very serotonin [01:40:12] Or very dopamine the get-after-it monday morning is for sharks or whatever I see this [01:40:17] That's all just these neuro chemical different neuro chemical systems. That's right [01:40:21] But when people get into a pattern of pursuing things that are detrimental to their goals [01:40:26] Like they want to raise a healthy [01:40:28] Safe family or they want to be in a relationship that feels nurturing and physically and emotionally safe [01:40:32] And they're making choices that are not in line with that [01:40:35] I do think it's worth looking to developmental upbringing and say well [01:40:38] Maybe my reward \", \" [01:40:38] Maybe my reward system is attached to exactly the thing that is wrong for [01:40:42] They need to start engaging their forebrain [01:40:45] and [01:40:46] Acknowledge that it's going to take a while like I keep sabotaging myself. I'm trying to just put this in like right self sabotage [01:40:53] People they're making poor poor decisions and excitement and sexual arousal are closely linked sexual arousal and relationships [01:41:01] I last heard are are closely linked. I think that's a fair and safe assessment [01:41:06] It's not the thing that brings together two members of a species to decide to invest resources [01:41:12] Are these chemical systems? [01:41:15] other systems as well plans and things but [01:41:18] At its core the glue is a chemical glue because let me I'm going to just [01:41:23] Say something non-scientific like this might not land great [01:41:27] But like, you know when you have a really good friend and they've dated a bunch of people and then [01:41:32] The person they picked to be like their husband or wife. You're like what her or him. That's the one [01:41:39] This is not okay. Like there's something else going on her\", \" something else going on here [01:41:42] And then usually the discussion is well, maybe there's something we don't know. Yeah, there's always like [01:41:47] Like there's always the like maybe there's something we don't know, right [01:41:50] Totally, it's sort of like what is she doing that? I don't know about is this is she doing kegels? [01:41:53] Like what's happening when you're just like that's the person and you're like, oh, there's some other thing going on here [01:41:58] Yeah, I think that it it's perplexing. Yeah, you know when we see these things [01:42:03] You know, there's another example that's um, maybe a little uncomfortable for people [01:42:06] But and I don't use these examples to make people uncomfortable. But when you look at non-randomness biology is very uncomfortable [01:42:12] Biology is uncomfortable non-randomness. So the incest thing where there's a genetic penalty [01:42:18] Fetishes are an interesting topic. Oh, love it. Why do so many guys want to [01:42:23] Fuck my feet [01:42:31] So if they're disgusting, I mean they're I don't have good feet so [01:42:36] They look like et's fingers. So [01:42:41] I'm just saying I don'\", \"2:41] I'm just saying I don't but I they do my training did not prepare me for this [01:42:45] Well, it's like my my second toe is like a slightly longer than my first toe. I don't know why anyone would want to [01:42:51] Isn't that supposed to be a sign of royalty? Yeah, thank you. Yes, actually gets me. Yeah, that's that's that's actually been [01:42:58] Well, so digit are you gonna take me off track digit ratio? [01:43:02] So I was part of a paper that was published in the year 2000 with a group out of berkeley was published in the journal nature [01:43:07] Digit ratios are dictated in utero [01:43:10] by hormone exposure [01:43:12] Whoa, yeah, and we can talk about this because it had implications for [01:43:16] Um heterosexual versus homosexual mate choice. This is a published paper. It's also true in animals [01:43:21] And I can give you that story. Um, if you want in a few minutes, but let me um [01:43:26] Let's talk about fetishes talking about fucking my feet [01:43:29] So the interesting thing about fetishes is, um, they're not random [01:43:34] People don't develop fetishes to lamp posts. It's very rare if they do, right or um paper towels [01\", \"right or um paper towels [01:43:41] Almost all the fetishes are to things that are infectious [01:43:46] feet [01:43:47] feces [01:43:48] corpses [01:43:49] These are like there are fetishes that are outside those realms [01:43:52] But is the feed from crawling around as a baby and seeing your mom's feet? [01:43:56] I'm gonna make a different argument, which is somewhat conjecture [01:43:59] But there's a there are circuits in our hypothalamus. We get this area right above the roof of our mouth [01:44:04] That is called the hypothalamus [01:44:06] It is everybody's important as the amygdala and all the other the hippocampus and all the other stuff that you hear about [01:44:10] Because it controls things like temperature regulation [01:44:12] sexual behavior, it's extremely important [01:44:16] The hypothalamus has neurons that control [01:44:20] Apetitive behaviors, meaning things we want to move toward [01:44:23] The mm stuff and then it also has neurons that live right next door to those neurons that control what we call aversive behaviors [01:44:30] The uh, the move away thing, right? Yeah, it was a Yiddish. Yeah, I was gonna say you guys have so man\", \"nna say you guys have so many complicated [01:44:39] Just we're coiling [01:44:41] Being approached retreat. Yeah grossed out [01:44:44] Desire whatever the reason I use those terms in case we want to go look up more and um [01:44:49] And just to make sure that it, you know, I stay within the bounds of some of the work on this stuff [01:44:54] So these these neurons control brain circuits that were designed to either move us towards things right food [01:45:03] Sex warmth when we're cold cool when we're warm [01:45:07] Etc or move us away from things that were dangerous to us [01:45:10] So think about vomit feces feet those corpses those things are not just gross [01:45:16] They are actually dangerous [01:45:17] They're dangerous from an infection standpoint [01:45:20] And it is no surprise that you have neurons that push you toward things draw you I should say toward you [01:45:26] Toward things that are good for you, right sugar fat [01:45:30] Reproduction we are a species that needs to propagate right right et cetera [01:45:34] But it needs to be context appropriate age appropriate species appropriate all that stuff, but you know what I mean [01:45:40\", \"u know what I mean [01:45:40] but [01:45:41] Also circuits that are aversive that force us to recoil the the no like gross and disgust pathogen avoidance [01:45:48] So it's kind of pathogen avoidance. So it's kind of interesting to think that [01:45:51] to reflect on the fact that many fetishes are rooted [01:45:55] In a crossover between [01:45:57] Desire and these things that are dangerous to us. I mean before antibiotics, which everyone's anti antibiotics antibiotics have saved many lives [01:46:05] Have cured many infections. There are with their appropriate use [01:46:09] Those things were dangerous. The reason we put bodies in the ground is because decaying bodies are infectious [01:46:15] So there's an uncomfortable and if people are feeling some discomfort even just hearing these phrases [01:46:19] That's these that's good. Those are the circuits. I'm talking about in action right now [01:46:23] so things like incest or [01:46:25] Or corpses or things that the reason we recoil to those dolls robots, you know, like when people look at my robot [01:46:32] They get freaked out and weirded out non animated forms of they say it looks like something th\", \"y it looks like something that would be sick or dead [01:46:38] That's right. Fuck this thing the hypothalamus could very well be thinking [01:46:42] That what you get creeped out by dolls by robots by clowns anything that looks human, but it's a little off [01:46:48] Right. So those are circuits where and i'm not out here to demonize people's behavior. I'm not a psychologist [01:46:55] I'm not I'm not I'm not judging anyone's behavior choices [01:46:58] But you can start to think of because you're asking the question [01:47:01] How is it that the thing that is worst for us is the thing that we desire [01:47:05] Why does this person go after it? Well, it means at a core level [01:47:09] It means that there is neural circuitry that has been wired up so that the thing that is supposed to be aversive [01:47:14] Has become a pettitive it put into english. It means the thing that you're supposed to say [01:47:19] That's disgusting. Yeah is attractive to you. Yeah, and i'm not putting any kind of moral judgment here one way or the other [01:47:24] I'm talking about what is safe biologically and evolutionarily speaking and what is not what's advantageous for ou\", \"t what's advantageous for our species and [01:47:33] Historically what has been disadvantageous or maladaptive? So [01:47:39] There are people that [01:47:41] like chaos and [01:47:43] Drama and it turns them on in a variety of ways right mentally and physically and [01:47:50] Much of therapy much of trauma release work much of work in the addiction community is centered around trying to do two things [01:47:58] One is to create new rewards that are associated with healthy [01:48:02] behaviors [01:48:03] Right [01:48:04] I mean 12 steps a really good example where the community aspect is a big part of it trying to create those bonds [01:48:09] Yes, an attachment to be new behaviors to try and pull that [01:48:14] Reward circuitry toward healthier things that are less tacky [01:48:18] That's tacky kind and less tacky kind if you're just think tacky bad [01:48:22] So yeah, so much of it is about [01:48:25] Fellowship and making emotional bonds and not isolating [01:48:28] That's a really big part of what why 12 step works right and move us away from I mean for an addict [01:48:34] And now i'm lumping addiction to this but for an addict whose life is going \", \" addict whose life is going down the tubes or spent all their money [01:48:39] Has lost their job has lost their family and they continue to want to use [01:48:43] It's clear that the reward pathway has been linked to something that's maladaptive [01:48:47] Now I realize as i'm saying this that and people are some people are probably thinking this is just a lot of [01:48:51] Neurospeak for what we already know [01:48:54] But there's an important [01:48:57] Operational or kind of verb element in this not just naming things but putting verb tenses on it [01:49:01] Which is if you want to build new healthy reward circuitry in any domain of life [01:49:07] relationships or related to [01:49:09] Drug behavior or avoiding drug behavior is what i'm referring to [01:49:13] It's very important that there's a behavior involved in [01:49:17] Moving away in creating new forms of rewarding things. This is why it's not sufficient to just sit there [01:49:23] and [01:49:24] You need a you need a carrot and a stick you need to push off the destructive behavior and you need to create new [01:49:31] intense rewards [01:49:33] Maybe as intense rewards for the health very a\", \"ewards for the health very action, right? So it can't be gratitude or cocaine. So let me ask you [01:49:39] It's got to be gratitude [01:49:42] As as the the competitor uh-huh cocaine addiction [01:49:45] But it's not just going to be gratitude because gratitude is never going to have that kind of intense dopamine release [01:49:49] It's going to have to be gratitude community [01:49:52] Job pursuit of new things that are exciting. There has to be a mode of excitement [01:49:57] Attached to the thing that you want. It can't just be passive for the good stuff and active [01:50:02] It's like wanting to go to it's like, you know changing your brain is the same as going to the gym [01:50:06] You can't just want to change your body without going to the gym. You can't want to change your brain without actually [01:50:10] um having the reward right so it's it's a [01:50:14] example although not perfect maybe in [01:50:17] Uh when you get sober after 30 days you get a chip, you know [01:50:20] And then you get a reward and then you get a cake and then it's a big part of it [01:50:22] It's baked into the um to those communities. I've spent some time in addiction \", \"pent some time in addiction treatment in trauma release communities [01:50:28] Slip of water. Please go for it. What did I open that? I saw you wanting to take what we call a fixed action pattern involves the brain [01:50:33] No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, there's a subset of neurons in the rhombom [01:50:37] You're just taking a drink of water. Can we just keep it simple? Um [01:50:43] Thirst isn't no I'm the uh [01:50:46] But I yeah, so do you fight with women when you date them? [01:50:50] I've never been in a fight with anybody [01:50:53] But what happens is it a nightmare? What's your main? What's the main feedback you get the main feedback that I get? [01:51:00] Yeah, sorry, this got really personal [01:51:02] Like our girl about about what just like [01:51:05] Oh, so you don't fucking care [01:51:08] Oh, I feel like you get that [01:51:10] Um, can I think about this? [01:51:12] Yes, that's so smart. Can I think about that and go for a walk and get back to you or how about this? [01:51:17] I hear you. I'm going to think about what you just said. Oh my god, never say I hear you never say I hear you [01:51:25] I'm triggered. There's so there's an I feel\", \"There's so there's an I feel cornered [01:51:27] There's a neurobiological rule, which is that whatever somebody says under these conditions will be the wrong thing [01:51:32] So I'm just gonna say nothing. Well, I do know horrible Hendrick says that [01:51:37] The way to communicate if you can't if if what the person is saying you're just not hearing [01:51:41] You're supposed to repeat what the other person says, right? [01:51:44] So I hear that you're uncomfortable and didn't it didn't land well with you that I came home at two in the morning [01:51:49] But I feel you know what I mean, right and you have to say I feel like this is happening not [01:51:54] You're doing this fucking thing. You have to say I feel like you're doing this fucking thing [01:51:58] right [01:52:03] You really do not take the bait you really well there [01:52:07] I mean I just [01:52:08] The reason I bring it up is because I think a lot of us are triggered by calmness [01:52:12] A lot of us are triggered by not getting an emotional reaction out of people because we equate it with not being loved [01:52:17] Or being emotionally abandoned or you know, we project like you said be\", \" we project like you said before [01:52:21] So if you're just like calmly listening to someone it could be like, oh, so you don't fucking care [01:52:25] Oh, you know, I think it's just fascinating to and talking about reading faces a lot of us project on the faces [01:52:32] You know, you might be reading them wrong. You might be [01:52:35] Half the time we don't even know what we think about ourselves and feel about ourselves [01:52:39] how in the world are we [01:52:41] Expected to know what other people think and you know, the world is devoid of any [01:52:48] Language that's adequate at [01:52:49] Explaining our feelings at a really core level. I just don't think that you know songs are much better at [01:52:55] You know conveying a sense of emotion than words are and they're kind of written form [01:52:59] Although there's some great poetry and books that will do that [01:53:02] But when someone wants to articulate how they feel and have the other person really understand [01:53:07] That's a that's a tough one. So this is why I think animals are wonderful because we could if we can [01:53:13] Adjust we can actually start to feel things at a more vi\", \" to feel things at a more visceral level. Um [01:53:19] I forget where we were a moment ago, but I'll just use this opportunity to say [01:53:23] um [01:53:24] That diaphragm thing that we were talking about before I'm not circling all the way back without intention here [01:53:30] Um, I've been spending some time with opera singers and talking to them [01:53:34] They actually can control their emotions [01:53:37] Not just [01:53:39] Through voice but through the reverberation frequency of their diaphragm. They talk about this [01:53:43] They can bring themselves to tears or to elation [01:53:46] And that's because the neurons that control that sighing double inhale exhale [01:53:49] And the diaphragm are sitting cheek to jowl with the neurons that control laughing [01:53:54] coughing [01:53:55] There's a really interesting study of called locked in syndrome. These are people that have remember that diving bell in the butterflies [01:54:01] That's the name of the movie. I haven't seen it [01:54:02] But that's I think the movie that describes locked in as in like you're locked in [01:54:06] Right. These people can't do anything except blink. They're paral\", \" except blink. They're paralyzed and they've looked at breathing in these people [01:54:11] And there's a famous and this is written in a in a scientific paper a case study paper [01:54:16] But a scientific paper nonetheless was somebody who locked in syndrome and they're measuring their breathing [01:54:21] And then their breathing suddenly changes and then they ask the person wait. What happened? [01:54:26] And they said, oh, um, you made a joke. I laughed [01:54:30] And so the breathing our breathing is also very connected to our emotional states [01:54:33] It's not just about calm alert. It's also about happy sad. It's about funny. It's about I think I'm choking [01:54:39] that's also an alert signal so [01:54:42] The diaphragm is very important. You asked earlier and I want to make sure that I answer your question about [01:54:46] Breathing with the ribs the chest breathing from the belly. Here's the deal [01:54:51] Mammals have a diaphragm so they can bring more oxygen into the lungs because they tend to have bigger brains than non-mammals [01:54:57] So reptiles will sit there. They only breathe with the muscles between the ribs. Yeah [01:55:01] We\", \"the ribs. Yeah [01:55:01] We have both we can breathe with our diaphragm or with our ribs [01:55:05] The whole concept that your belly has to extend when you breathe in [01:55:09] And contract when you breathe out. Sorry folks not true [01:55:13] The whole system was wired so you could I can inhale and bring my belly in [01:55:17] Or I can do it this way [01:55:19] Either way and I don't have any kind of like weird yogic whatever control [01:55:23] It was designed to work any which way [01:55:26] And there's now kind of a movement in the athletic performance and movement community of saying, oh, you know belly breathing is bad [01:55:33] Belly breathing isn't that belly breathing isn't good. Sometimes you need to breathe with your ribs when you run really hard [01:55:37] You're going to breathe with your ribs and diaphragm [01:55:39] So there's a lot of kind of like garbage out there about you only use 10 percent of your brain [01:55:43] It's like who came up with that one and if you use your home percent of your brain [01:55:46] You'd be you have a guess it's called a seizure, you know or we can't multitask we can I would avoid any [01:55:52] Um blanket\", \"id any [01:55:52] Um blanket statements like that, but anyway, if you're breathing weight [01:56:01] Scientists are pretty nerdy we like we like [01:56:03] But so breathing with your ribs is fine [01:56:05] But the more that you can engage the diaphragm the more oxygen you can bring into your system [01:56:09] But in any of it, I I just want to make sure that we um, you know, tied those up because I [01:56:14] Remember they can am I allowed to go on another tangent. You know podcasts are just tangent after tangent after dancing [01:56:19] I don't keep your brain. You're you know, you're you're an ulcer. You're an ulcer in shepherd [01:56:22] You keep wanting to hurt oh no, that's my least favorite [01:56:26] You want to keep things organized? No, I [01:56:28] I spent some time on the beach this morning with my dog and that the um, there was an aussie shepherd out there [01:56:34] It would like go and turn around and look at us [01:56:36] Costello was my bulldog who's looking at me like what is that animal like that's totally foreign and you know [01:56:41] And before everybody listening they know like my love of my life [01:56:46] Uh, sort of passion bre\", \":46] Uh, sort of passion breed our pit bulls who have this reputation for being, you know, treculant and [01:56:51] Pugnacious and so for the on the same token, I'll say that [01:56:55] Huskies do need to run and they do have a certain amount of exercise. They need to get and they are very high energy [01:57:01] Obviously, they you know need a certain temperature because of their coat [01:57:04] They've evolved to do a certain thing but there are so many stereotypes that are incorrect about [01:57:09] Um [01:57:11] These as well on the same token [01:57:13] Um, because so much of it is nurture in terms of aggression level and stuff [01:57:17] So it's like a pit bull. Yes is bred to do the maximum amount of damage if the nurture has been abused [01:57:23] But it is not what they're inherently bred to do. They're actually, um, nanny dogs. They're actually bred to watch children [01:57:28] Yeah, they're amazing with kids. Yeah when their nurture is negative. They can do the maximum amount of damage [01:57:34] I lost an ear like I I yeah, my ear was bitten off [01:57:38] It was sewed back on. Wow. Yeah by a pit bull. Yeah by a by a mix [01:57:43] Yeah, yeah,\", \"a mix [01:57:43] Yeah, yeah, so and there's no such thing as pit bull. It's like pit bull is also [01:57:48] So yeah, so I'm also nomenclature like in this area is so important because there's such a negative association of the word pit bull [01:57:53] Like um to what you were saying before certain words like can just you know trigger people's fear and amygdala so quickly [01:57:58] So we say staffy. We say pity stuff like that trying to sort of change the [01:58:03] Association with it. Um, but I do want to go a tangent on about some things that served us really well [01:58:10] in the past, uh [01:58:11] As as humans and we know they did because we our reward system was activated. We get serotonin or dopamine things like [01:58:21] One of the biggest fights I get in in relationships is that I want to pop zits [01:58:27] I'm popping all your zits. I'm popping all your zits. Yes [01:58:31] All your zits. You've never had a girl do that. I know there are it seems to be a consistent theme [01:58:37] In relationships that um and people have these picking things, right? I mean, there's some people there [01:58:41] Every girl I know has to I have to tweeze you\", \" has to I have to tweeze your ingrown hairs [01:58:45] I have to tweeze your eyebrows and I have to pop your zits. It is actually [01:58:49] like to me it's it's [01:58:52] Well, we're primates. It's totally but we get I was gonna say something kind of dirty and I restrained myself [01:58:58] um for you [01:58:59] But I you know, it's something that now seems annoying and naggy and perfectionistic and nitpicky [01:59:05] But in the past that's something that's served us really really well, right? Well, I think it does still now. I think that [01:59:11] Um, it's about removing infection from the body [01:59:14] I think if you look at primate species, they groom each other and we can serotonin from it, right? [01:59:20] Um [01:59:21] I I wouldn't be surprised. I'm not aware of any specific [01:59:24] When I pop is it it's I it's like an orgasm for me [01:59:30] So maybe this is like a foot fetish. Oh my god, I'm a fetish [01:59:36] I mean, there there's a substantial community online. Have you ever picked it ingrown hair with a tweezer? [01:59:42] Nothing feels better. I don't think I own a tweezer. We have them in the lab, but I would never groomed [01:59\", \"I would never groomed [01:59:49] Look, I have one of these. This is nose hair clippers. I have that looks like a taser. Yeah [01:59:55] He manscaped we got to get you some merch [01:59:57] um [01:59:59] I think behaviors that remove infection from the body [02:00:02] Are adaptive behaviors and I think there's with adaptive behaviors [02:00:06] There's always going to be two components. We already talked about them earlier [02:00:09] One is a kind of a version for something like we got to get that out [02:00:13] We got to get away from it [02:00:14] I thought if I see a zit on someone that I'm dating or like a whitehead or a pimple or a blackhead or something [02:00:20] It's all I can think about. I have to get it [02:00:22] So it's a strong evolutionary drive there makes sense to get out infection from the body [02:00:27] And then there's sounds like for you in particular there's a there's a reward you in your case [02:00:33] In your case a significant reward from the feeling that it is now ejected from the body. I've even done it with x's [02:00:41] I'll be hanging out with an action. I'm like, can I just get that? [02:00:44] We're not together anymore.\", \" We're not together anymore. This is weird. Um, I don't know where the boundaries lie [02:00:50] For that [02:00:53] But have you had women do that too? [02:00:56] Yes [02:00:57] Okay, but you see how like it's so uncontrollable, but it's even like I'll give a more benign non-sexual example [02:01:04] Like a guy with porn. There's no getting between. Well, it's like, you know, I have an older sister [02:01:07] I'm a younger brother and she would she used to say things like like, oh, I have to do this to your [02:01:12] I have to pluck your eyebrows or you've got to do this thing or you have to do it [02:01:14] I'm like, you know, I don't have to do anything. She's like, I want to she it seemed like there was like a strong drive [02:01:19] Just no getting between me and a blackhead [02:01:22] It's an obsession and then after I do it I think about it [02:01:25] So I replay in my head and there are and I swear I don't I don't watch these but I you know, there's a [02:01:32] YouTube is a very interesting portal into the human psyche, right? I mean, why is it that a [02:01:39] Movie of a shark attack gets [02:01:42] You know 40 million views and a lecture fro\", \"lion views and a lecture from the world a world expert on kind of the history of viruses five years ago [02:01:49] Saying a pandemic was coming. No one cared [02:01:52] Right. I mean that you know, you look at the there's the more limbic something is the more it engages the [02:01:57] Hypothalamus in these areas of the brain that are related to either [02:02:01] Apeditive the things we want to pursue or a verse of behaviors or both in the [02:02:06] The more people are going to want to engage in those behaviors and I think in something you're saying [02:02:10] I think explains a lot of what's going on when we're we're also confounded by [02:02:14] Twitter mobs we're confounded by cancel culture twitter mob. I have a twitter account, but I don't go on there much [02:02:20] I'm not it. I'm not active on twitter [02:02:22] Instagram. Yes, I can pass but not twitter. But what is a twitter mob? Like when someone [02:02:28] An old tweet resurfaces that was offensive or problematic and then twitter jumps on everyone [02:02:35] sort of [02:02:37] Gets in their self-righteous indignation and superiority complexes and fuck this person cancel this person [02:02:43]\", \"ancel this person [02:02:43] There's some a trending hashtag of so-and-so is over party hashtag Whitney is over party [02:02:49] And to me it it's a feeding frenzy. It's a twitter mob where they're piling on one person primitive very primitive behavior [02:02:55] It's it's almost like the talent what's evolved to behavior because it's on the computer [02:02:58] But it's very the the underpinnings of it are very primitive primitive and it isn't it basically I equate it to our modern day [02:03:06] Rome coliseum, you know, and it's we've always done this in some way [02:03:10] I mean [02:03:11] What's kind of eerie is that so there's a paper published in a very high quality journal this last year in a cell [02:03:16] Press journal which is a very high quality journal house [02:03:19] Um showing that beliefs are actually attached to the reward system to the dopamine system [02:03:24] So when people see evidence of something they already believe [02:03:29] It's it's like a dope. It's like a drug hit for them [02:03:32] It the confirmation bias goes way beyond just I see more of what I expect or I knew it [02:03:38] Beliefs actually have their own intrinsic r\", \"y have their own intrinsic reward and people out there saying [02:03:43] Oh, well, of course that makes of course it does but no [02:03:46] This actually means that you're reinforcing beliefs through a chemical system [02:03:50] That leads you to see that your beliefs are actually more [02:03:54] Chemically powerful to you than other people's beliefs even if it's not true [02:03:58] So if I believe the earth is flat and I go on facebook and I see someone saying the earth is flat [02:04:03] I get ahead of dopamine [02:04:05] What is the biological basis for that? Like why would we have needed that in the past? [02:04:09] Well, I mean our [02:04:10] You know, and I'm not an expert in human evolutionary behavior at the level of culture [02:04:14] Where I know a thing first of all no one really understands evolutionary biology [02:04:18] All you evolutionary biologists out there and neuroscientists. I hate to tell you [02:04:22] There is no fossil record of neural circuits [02:04:25] There are skulls, but those skulls are empty [02:04:28] So this is one of the big challenges of understanding our own evolution [02:04:31] Is that there's no fossil record of ne\", \"ere's no fossil record of neurology all those skulls empty [02:04:34] So we have to look at body form and skull shape and infer what the underlying neural circuitry was so when someone tells me [02:04:41] Oh, you know [02:04:43] Evolutionarily this makes sense. I I'm on board because there's a logic there [02:04:46] But when they tell me oh that the circuits were once like this and then like there's no fossil record [02:04:51] Because it all decays and you just get the skull and the skeleton in the body plane now [02:04:55] That can tell you a lot, but we could [02:04:58] imagine or hypothesize that [02:05:01] We needed to exist in groups to develop tools that were beyond a physical capacity of any one person [02:05:08] To develop cultures a lot of our brain structure is socio biological [02:05:13] And when people agree in groups, there's great strength to that [02:05:18] Even if they're wrong. Well, and when you when you're a dissenter [02:05:22] You are actually taking yourself out of the resource pool. Yes, you're ostracized [02:05:26] You're less likely to protect it and it's at a core level. It's resources, right? [02:05:30] It's the you know, we ar\", \"30] It's the you know, we are not everything is being is driven to reproduce, you know, some people including myself don't have kids [02:05:37] et cetera, but [02:05:40] Evolution is about the offspring. It is not about the parents like it doesn't care evolution doesn't have a mind [02:05:45] it doesn't care about [02:05:48] Us it cares about the next generation the next generation the next generation [02:05:51] It's we're we're wired to propagate mostly [02:05:54] And to secure the safety and well-being of the offspring. That's not an excuse if you've cheated [02:05:59] No, in fact, hey, dr. Human told me we're wired to propagate [02:06:02] I'm definitely not I definitely don't want to meddle in anyone's relationships or or behaviors, right? [02:06:08] I mean today. It's just the neuroscience lens on these things because that's what we do all day [02:06:12] We're kind of just playing whack-a-mole with our reptilian brains and our primordial instincts, right? [02:06:16] And the threshold for typing something out online is much lower than the threshold for actually having to go and [02:06:21] Have a conversation with somebody face to face be confrontation\", \"ace to face be confrontational [02:06:25] um [02:06:26] Yeah, the so I didn't know about these twitter mobs. Do they exist on other social platforms or like have you like? [02:06:31] Have you heard um of like people that got canceled? Yeah, no [02:06:34] It makes sense. But do they is it only on twitter or do they exist? It's not only on twitter [02:06:37] I mean it's sort of like a it's it's a pile on it's basically [02:06:42] People and to me it it so clearly feels like addictive behavior like this adrenaline dopamine head [02:06:47] of we're all gonna like pile on this person and you know [02:06:50] I think there's this subconscious tell me if i'm wrong from a scientific perspective of like [02:06:55] Of like the same way when you see um [02:06:57] A car wreck or something like you have this [02:07:00] Need to look and see what happens because it's our way of figuring out, you know [02:07:04] At least in terms of you know, what's in the zeitgeist and what's problematic and what's not of like [02:07:08] It's our way of studying what's appropriate and what's not and where the boundaries are and what we're allowed to say [02:07:12] Not allowed to say and\", \"7:12] Not allowed to say and it's our way of going that person's guilty [02:07:15] We must be safe right and the threshold keeps getting higher if you see a horror movie that's really really extreme [02:07:22] Movies that you've seen previously that we're really thrilling to you won't seem as thrilling [02:07:27] Yeah, right so unless you're a real hitchcock fan or you're really into kind of the slow burn of a hitchcock movie [02:07:32] If you see something that's really intense visual horror the hitchcock thing isn't going to seem scary [02:07:36] Yeah, it's just the way that our dopamine system is wired is it wants to go for higher and higher thresholds [02:07:42] There's a name for it, which is dopamine reward prediction error. You can look it up if you want, but basically [02:07:47] You anticipate that the intense pleasure that is has an element of surprise and novelty [02:07:54] So I think also people are seeking novelty. It's very easy to find online [02:07:57] I think most people are familiar with the experience of waking up looking at their instagram feed or other [02:08:03] Thing on on a screen doesn't matter if it's instagram or not [02:08:06] \", \"instagram or not [02:08:06] And not even knowing why you're there. Yeah, are you are you seeking reward? [02:08:11] Are you seeking to pun or something and the I think the short answer is most people are not there for any specific reason [02:08:16] It's that it's tapping into a great number of these neurochemical systems [02:08:20] And we've now passed it from learned to reflexive, which is what the nervous system wants to do [02:08:25] And is that part of building up a tolerance? Is that is that in late? We're seeking more dopamine [02:08:30] We're seeking we don't even know what we're seeking. Yeah, but we're seeking at the end of the day [02:08:34] That's right. It's mindless. It's mindless is mental chewing gum that has there's no nutritional value at the end point [02:08:40] Now there are elements of social media. I teach neuroscience on social media. So I'm I'm there. There's happening. How bad is it? [02:08:46] My teaching on social media [02:08:48] I don't know you have to ask you have to ask somebody else [02:08:52] I'm gonna go and read it. Well, I used to be teaching evaluations [02:08:56] Out there and um and don't do that anymore. They do th\", \" do that anymore. They do there there is rate my professor [02:09:01] Like zag it for professors. Yeah, and there those are out there. I think um, that's not as popular anymore [02:09:07] That was a few years back [02:09:08] No, I mean like how bad like what's the bottom line because I hear rehabs are opening for social media and phones [02:09:15] Sorry, oh that like how bad is it to to search online top line like how bad is our addiction to social media? [02:09:20] How bad is this for our brains? I know that's a huge question. I think I think people ought to consider [02:09:25] Why they're there? [02:09:27] And I do think that are the amount of time spent [02:09:30] On the phone and searching other people's content is inversely related to our own creativity and productivity [02:09:36] Doesn't mean I don't use these things. I do but great creative works have not come from scrolling feeds [02:09:42] However ideas interactions [02:09:45] Getting to know people in different communities. There there's some wonderful things about social media too [02:09:49] We just have to be very very deliberate and very very conscious of how we're using and I think that you\", \"e using and I think that you know [02:09:53] In something the way that you define addiction. I believe is a narrowing of things that bring you pleasure [02:09:58] I define addiction as a [02:10:00] Through the lens of neuroscience [02:10:01] I define addiction as a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure [02:10:06] and [02:10:07] Dare I say I define enlightenment as a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure [02:10:12] I don't know what it means to be enlightened, but I know that the more things that can bring me pleasure [02:10:16] The happier and [02:10:18] More enlightened. I feel whatever that means and that's purely subjective and no [02:10:21] That's not a double-blind peer-reviewed controlled study in my laboratory. That's my experience [02:10:26] The addiction thing is definitely rooted in a lot of neurobiological studies [02:10:29] Which show that as people get addicted the source of dopamine [02:10:33] Starts a narrow a narrow a narrow to just the exact thing and in certain with certain drugs like cocaine and amphetamine in particular [02:10:40] They chemically are almost identical to dopamine. Not identic\", \"cal to dopamine. Not identical, but they're similar enough [02:10:45] So you're now they're literally ingesting the molecule that you're used to use behaviors to [02:10:51] Release in your mind. Well, I do think it's people who wonder like is am I addicted to my phone? [02:10:55] Am I addicted to social media? I think a lot of people, uh, you know ask me [02:10:59] I'm not an expert but like I can't tell if I'm an addict or not. I can't tell if this is a healthy amount or health [02:11:03] I think the the I love saying these definitions because it will help you understand like if there's a problem and number one [02:11:09] you know [02:11:10] What's due with it, which is another definition that I love is um [02:11:14] To continue to do something despite negative consequences like every day you're going [02:11:18] Oh, fuck. I just wasted another six hours on social media the next day you find yourself [02:11:21] Ah my screen time six hours again. You just keep doing the same. How did I do this? Why did I do this? [02:11:25] I'll try a different definition the one that I think of is look [02:11:30] Can I be addicted to water? [02:11:32] Sure, but it takes \", \"2:11:32] Sure, but it takes a lot of water drinking [02:11:35] Before the baseline on my life starts to go down. Yeah, so I think of all behaviors as they're either baseline neutral [02:11:41] Meaning my job my social connections my finances, etc. Are neutral doesn't change them [02:11:46] There are behaviors that improve my social connections my occupational goals my [02:11:51] Everything and then there are behaviors that will drive the baseline on your life down very fast like heroin [02:11:57] Is a good example [02:11:58] Yeah, massive opioid release and dopamine release in the brain people's lives fall apart almost every single time quickly [02:12:04] Yeah, right. It's gonna happen. So everyone can agree [02:12:08] Heroin is very addictive water is not very addictive. What do we mean by that? [02:12:12] Well, there are people that I know that have to drink a lot of water and they have to drink a certain kind of water and etc [02:12:17] well [02:12:19] If they're doing that and the sounds really annoying. Yeah, well [02:12:23] Those people those they're not super abundant in today's society, but um [02:12:29] There are a lot of behaviors that are anno\", \"t of behaviors that are annoying invasive high maintenance, etc [02:12:33] You hear this kind of language, but the baseline on their life isn't changing. They're still good parents. They're still good partners [02:12:38] They're still happy inside [02:12:40] So I think if you're asking the question am I addicted to my phone or phone behavior the question is well [02:12:46] Is your job suffering? How much are your social interaction suffering? I would say [02:12:51] You know it used to be that when people come out of surgery [02:12:54] They would reach first for their genitalia. This is a well-described phenomenon in the [02:12:59] surgical world [02:13:01] Right. I'm not a surgeon, but friends are a surgeon like it's totally true people come out of anesthesia [02:13:04] The first thing they do. Okay, not that I think about the surgeon [02:13:08] Leaves. I'm not a surgeon, but I'm going to assume. No the patient got a patient like kind of reaches for these [02:13:15] They're reproductive organs like safety. It's like if they're by now they reach for their phone [02:13:21] They're [02:13:22] Yeah, so is that a lowering of the baseline in their life? [02:13\", \"seline in their life? [02:13:27] Probably not does it interfere with like but it it speaks to the like really deep and kind of primal level that these devices are starting to [02:13:35] Occupy. I mean, I don't want to demonize the phone, but I will say this [02:13:37] I think we also equate them with safety. That's the other thing that when people slam phones and you're addicted to your phone [02:13:42] It's also it's like but I also carry this around when I leave the house and I feel safer knowing I can make a phone call [02:13:47] You know what I mean? [02:13:48] It's sort of like the fact that we used to leave the house without phones is so wild to me [02:13:51] And that's the time where I'm like, ah, I'm not going to over pathologize this like it makes me feel safe [02:13:56] Right. There are elements within the phone and even just the physical architecture of the phone because we're not in panoramic vision [02:14:01] We're looking into this little box that are increasing stress [02:14:03] But I also understand that being away from the phone is very stressful. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [02:14:08] So, you know, it's weird. I mean, it's also it's so funny becau\", \"t's also it's so funny because I was um [02:14:13] You know [02:14:14] Thinking about this the other day of the phone [02:14:16] I'm thinking about getting a camera because I realized so much of my phone is the camera [02:14:20] Like I'm not really addicted to texting and emailing like I hate that shit [02:14:24] But to me it's when I go somewhere I have an addiction to documenting things and like I need to get a photo of this, you know [02:14:30] It's almost like I'm addicted to taking photos of things [02:14:32] Which might be more my fear of missing out or my fear of forgetting something or my fear of not having proof of something [02:14:38] Or you just like photos. I just like photo [02:14:40] Yeah [02:14:41] Let me overthink this [02:14:43] Um, there are so many things that I'm have we have not gotten to so I'm going to jump around like crazy [02:14:48] Because something we didn't mention around the fear and anxiety thing and they being attracted to people that cause you ostensible stress or [02:14:56] You know, I think there's been you know, I think this is why words are just so important. I think that [02:15:02] Fear and anxiety have been romantic\", \"d anxiety have been romanticized a lot [02:15:06] in [02:15:07] You know movies whatever books [02:15:09] In relationships where when you meet someone and you feel butterflies or you feel we've I think been talked to conflate [02:15:16] Fear or anxiety with like passion, you know, like what from your perspective [02:15:22] What are butterflies when you meet someone? Is that your body telling you to turn the fuck around or is that your body telling you? [02:15:28] Like this is your soulmate because sometimes I think our bodies send us signals and we've [02:15:33] Changed what they mean because of like romance novels and music songs and whatever [02:15:38] Well broadly speaking and I want to just be clear that this is I know I'm using kind of a broad contour [02:15:43] I'm not getting down in the weeds of this [02:15:46] Alertness and what we call autonomic arousal or just kind of arousal and alertness, which is adrenaline [02:15:52] On its own. Mm-hmm is generally negative [02:15:54] It's designed to get us to move away from if you feel butterflies [02:15:57] Is that a pit in your stomach telling you this person's dangerous? Okay, I'll answer that in a se\", \"ay, I'll answer that in a second [02:16:02] Adrenaline and arousal plus dopamine [02:16:06] Is desire [02:16:08] Physiologically, they're almost identical at the level of the body except one has this additional chemical of desire [02:16:14] shit [02:16:16] The butterflies are in part, but largely [02:16:21] The activation of that phrenic nerve to diaphragm connection [02:16:24] That reverberation. This is what opera singers are exceptionally good at bringing into their into their voice so that you feel [02:16:31] What they're saying if you listen, I'm not a big opera fan [02:16:33] But I've been listening more of it lately because I've been interacting with these opera singers [02:16:36] And there are elements to their vocalizations where you feel something. That's right [02:16:40] I have no idea what they're saying. I don't speak Italian [02:16:43] But it sounds amazing and you can see it and if you look at their faces or not it can change things [02:16:48] but [02:16:49] So that reverberation the butterflies is it's a feeling and I think that [02:16:54] We should probably all learn we could all afford to better [02:16:58] Understand what these reverber\", \"derstand what these reverberations mean that those butterflies could be [02:17:03] Arousal that's meant to say get out of there [02:17:06] Like this is because remember arousal adrenaline changes your nervous system [02:17:09] Which changes your musculature to make you want to move [02:17:12] Right serotonin changes your nervous system changes your musculature in a way that makes you want to relax [02:17:18] okay, so [02:17:20] The but remember you throw dopamine into the mix and all of a sudden there's intense desire for this thing [02:17:26] That's really exciting. Some people love roller coasters for take two people hate them, you know [02:17:31] Some people one you have a good friend. He's spent, you know 20 plus years in the ceo teams [02:17:36] He was a [02:17:37] CEO a commanding officer in the ceo teams. He hates roller coasters. His wife loves them. Okay, so [02:17:43] Same experience same visceral experience [02:17:47] The addition of one molecule dopamine changes. She likes it. He doesn't he'll do it because he's a team guy [02:17:54] And they he's not gonna not do it. I'm gonna be a bitch. Yeah, he's gonna do it. It doesn't it doesn't terrify\", \"t doesn't it doesn't terrifying [02:17:58] He just doesn't enjoy it. Yeah unpleasant for him. She loves that's what it's like for me [02:18:02] I'm just like when is this gonna be over when is this gonna be over? [02:18:04] Exactly [02:18:04] But so I think that most people should have some sort of practice either maybe through [02:18:10] Well-guided therapy or maybe just through a sense of intuition of learning to read these signals [02:18:15] As we talked about in an earlier conversation offline, you know animals are exceptionally good at understanding [02:18:20] What these signals from their body? [02:18:23] Humans are still speculating about it and I don't have all the answers. There's great books like The Body Keeps The Score [02:18:28] Yeah, right under both. I can never pronounce the name the Dutch goodness the tough name [02:18:33] The body keeps the score a great book forgive me for butchering the name [02:18:36] but [02:18:37] There are body signals that are positive, right? There are body signals that are negative and learning to distinguish those [02:18:43] And including the mind it's not body only a lot of people have kind of taken this [02:\", \"have kind of taken this [02:18:47] The body keeps the score to mean that it's the only source of information for the nervous system [02:18:51] That's as stupid as saying, you know, the brain is the only thing that matters, right? [02:18:55] It's brain and body [02:18:56] And so I think that people learning to how these things connect for them [02:19:00] Is going to be important. Some people are more embodied [02:19:02] They're more in touch with the brain body connection than others [02:19:05] And some people are really out of their body and could benefit from somatic type therapies [02:19:09] Some people are really in their bodies and then you talk to them a lot of extreme creatives are like this [02:19:14] Where you talk to them and they're kind of all over their place. It's like they're non-linear all the time [02:19:18] Yeah, I won't name names because I don't know these people and I actually really love their art and music [02:19:23] But I hear some interviews with some creative musicians. I'm like [02:19:27] They like two plus two equals nine for them [02:19:30] You know, and it's cool because it allows them to reorganize elements in ways that are \", \"e elements in ways that are creative that are new and different [02:19:36] Whereas you talk to somebody who's an engineer or as a math background or a science background [02:19:40] And they're always striving for linearity [02:19:42] That you always said, you know, I'm like that whatever that yeah, you are doing that [02:19:46] I can't even say because I don't like [02:19:48] Always trying to get create structure. So these are two different aspects of the mind and I think [02:19:54] There's nothing wrong with butterflies [02:19:56] But you have to ask yourself are these butterflies of attraction or butterflies of like this person makes me fearful [02:20:03] Yeah, and for the people that say this person makes me fearful and I like it [02:20:07] Yeah, you should do a little bit of therapy before you get involved [02:20:10] But or do therapy together like again, I'm not a psychologist [02:20:13] But I think that the questions that you're asking what I love about them [02:20:16] Is they're getting to the core elements of this push pull in biology vomit chocolate chip cookies, right? [02:20:24] feces [02:20:25] Clean crisp water when you're thirsty. Yeah, rig\", \"en you're thirsty. Yeah, right the reason I'm using these kind of extreme examples is these are hardwired circuits [02:20:32] And then you think about relationship with somebody that's destructive for us [02:20:36] Versus relationship with somebody that's really nurturing. But wait, why are people getting pulled this way? [02:20:41] Well, clearly there hasn't been enough introspection and linking of the mind-body connection to figure out [02:20:46] Maybe their physical arousal is tied to something that cognitively is unhealthy for you. Yes my 20s [02:20:53] Yes [02:20:55] You do know how to bite your tongue which I do appreciate learned that the um through a lot of uh [02:21:02] Failures a lot of lobotomy is who gave her I only have one lobotomy [02:21:06] So far as I don't have any lobotomies. Okay, so I'm gonna ask you a bunch of like quick [02:21:11] Questions because I have so many more. She's asking me to be succinct. I'm literally no. I'm not no [02:21:14] I'm not gonna let you go until I'm [02:21:17] I don't let people I'm happy to talk to neuroscience. What are you gonna do? Do you even have Wi-Fi? [02:21:22] I didn't give you the code. I'm happy\", \"give you the code. I'm happy to talk neuroscience until you tap out. I want to uh, [02:21:27] Why does it feel so fucking good when I organize shit? [02:21:32] That is a primordial instinct [02:21:34] I'm just trying to [02:21:35] Depathologize a lot of behaviors that drive people crazy in relationships. Get your fucking wet towel off the bed [02:21:43] I like I can't handle a wet towel on the bed. Will you just answer or nurture? [02:21:47] Will you just answer the question I was about to ask which was not because you said I love organizing stuff [02:21:53] And then I was going to ask how much does it bother you when things are disorganized? [02:21:57] And I think you answered it with the technology. It's fun and I know and two things happen number one [02:22:01] I get you know, I I grew up without money. So I have a scarcity complex and I and I really respect things [02:22:09] I'm not materialistic, but I respect things. I value them [02:22:12] I I cherish them because I didn't get a lot of things growing up [02:22:15] So I'm sure there's a little bit of nurture involved and like I bought this thing or if I can [02:22:19] Benton drives me nuts because \", \"nton drives me nuts because he'll walk in with wet feet on the wooden floor [02:22:24] There's certain things that drive me absolutely nuts [02:22:26] But I'm also a horse girl and I'm fine being covered in dirt and shit and I'll pick up dog [02:22:30] Like I don't I'm very [02:22:32] I'm not precious about that kind of stuff. I'm fine with bugs and spider [02:22:35] But like disrespecting things really bothers me and the fact that I just said I [02:22:40] Need organization and this desk looks like a fucking yard sale. It's going to make me seem like I'm a pathological liar, but [02:22:47] I can't I can't tell if it's I feel disrespected or I need the organization [02:22:52] I just like I'm more calm when things are organized and if I'm stressed out [02:22:57] Organization is the number one thing that calms me down not a massage [02:23:01] Not a you know, just if I can just go organize the bookshelf. I'll be okay [02:23:05] Maybe it's productivity and cooperation make dopamine and I'm just [02:23:09] It's all sense of control. Um, I'll ask you a question and I think it'll answer your question. Okay your answer answer the question [02:23:17] You have a lo\", \"ion [02:23:17] You have a lot of experience working with animals. Yeah [02:23:20] Do animals organize their space? Yes, there you go. It's adaptive [02:23:27] Maybe that's not the answer you want. I don't organize my space. Do you want me? Well, right? [02:23:31] That'd be wonderful. Yeah, um, you know, they do it to varying degrees, but again, it gets back to this [02:23:36] Acne popping is it popping thing [02:23:40] Organization is predictability. Yes, and it frees up brain space for other operations. So [02:23:48] Perhaps I should have mentioned this at the beginning [02:23:49] But in addition to doing interoception extra reception inside outside analysis of real estate in us and etc all that stuff [02:23:56] The brain wants to learn things and then pass it off to reflexive behaviors so that it can learn more things [02:24:03] Horses are really good at what horses do [02:24:06] Diving birds are really good at what diving birds do animals are specialists [02:24:09] The human animal has a nervous system in brain that is really good at learning things and loves to learn things [02:24:15] Some people more than others [02:24:17] But when we learn we're an\", \"] But when we learn we're analyzing three things [02:24:20] Duration how long something's going to take path what path should it take outcome when you write your comedy routines [02:24:26] You think those up you're thinking duration path and outcome. It's a very creative iterative process very particular to you [02:24:33] But once you learn how to do something you pass it off to reflexive behavior [02:24:36] You don't have to think about how to walk down the hall because you learn that when you were this big [02:24:41] so [02:24:42] organizing things [02:24:43] frees up mental space so that you can be [02:24:47] Devoted to duration path and outcome analysis of the things that are important to you now [02:24:51] We all know people that can tolerate a mess. Okay, my postdoc advisor [02:24:55] I know i've been talking about him recently to you offline and ben barris who's incredible mind just brilliant mind [02:25:01] His office [02:25:04] Literally piles of papers my graduate advisor brilliant mind incredible human being her office was a [02:25:11] Stie [02:25:12] I sometimes we walk in there. I couldn't see her now. These are two highly accomplished neuro\", \"wo highly accomplished neurology neurologists mdphds [02:25:19] One wasn't the other was just a phd, but mdphds members of the national academy of sciences [02:25:24] One had a family was very functional in the family life. The other was a pure scientist [02:25:27] But I mean i'm talking high high functioning people, but they had one thing in common [02:25:32] They didn't see mess [02:25:34] They literally I'd say I'd walk in there and i'm like ben [02:25:37] How can you work like this and he was just like don't touch anything because I won't be able to find it [02:25:41] This might organize mess. I'm like, how can you find anything? I can't even find you. Yeah, you know, he's buying this wall of papers [02:25:47] So his mind was very narrowly tuned to just a couple things in life [02:25:51] He had tremendous concern for a couple narrow bands of attention and he was a little different [02:25:55] He was a little bit on the kind of he was not autistic or asperges [02:26:00] He had a lot of you know sensitivity actually an interpersonal sensitivity [02:26:04] But he couldn't recognize faces. He had a face face recognition deficit [02:26:08] He you know, he \", \" [02:26:08] He you know, he was different [02:26:10] He didn't see the mess if you see the mess like you would you wouldn't have been able to go into their offices [02:26:15] You would have just been like there are people that just don't see mess. I don't see it [02:26:18] But if you do [02:26:19] It's hard to do anything else until that's in its place [02:26:22] So I would say it's adaptive if it gets to the point where the baseline in your life is going down [02:26:28] Right people who are cleaning and cleaning cleaning all the time [02:26:31] Just like hoarding is terrible. Yeah for the baseline on life cleaning constantly [02:26:36] We say if it's making your life unmanageable, right if your job running 20 minutes, right if it's harming great relation [02:26:41] What would otherwise be great relationship? [02:26:43] I might have I might have blown up a couple relationships because of a pair of shoes that were left in a place like one was slightly off angle from the other [02:26:51] I saw scuff on the shoe and that was it. Yeah, so so I would say it's adaptive because we see [02:26:56] You're starting to get a glimpse into the way I think about things\", \"the way I think about things because we see [02:26:59] Evidence of it in other species that [02:27:02] We share neurology with humans are different. We have brain areas. They're different, but all animals have [02:27:09] Brain areas that control our breathing all animals have brain areas that control our heartbeat all brain areas have have brain areas that control [02:27:15] Wanted to get infection out [02:27:16] Monkeys lick and pick yep humans lick and pick and when you say adaptive like to me a synonym is like I got this honestly [02:27:24] I'm not crazy. I'm not a psycho. I've been brilliantly [02:27:28] I've evolved to do this thing and it's why our species proliferated. This is what it's like to fight with me [02:27:33] I go this is how I'm wired [02:27:36] It's not my fault. There's like like the train left the station a very long time ago in terms of this [02:27:41] And it would be very uncomfortable for you to try and rewire this and it doesn't sound like the baseline on your life [02:27:45] Is going down as a consequence your home is very orderly and it's very beautiful and like that's something to be proud of [02:27:50] I think remember the on\", \":50] I think remember the one of jordan peterson's thing was like clean your room or something like that [02:27:54] And one of his like 12 rules to life and it's a beautiful one because it's so simple, but it's like [02:27:59] Put your house in impeccable order. I think that's what he said to me [02:28:02] It's a little bit like if when your house is a mess you're a mess [02:28:04] It's like the reflection of I always I always know what's going on with me based on what my car looks like [02:28:09] If I've got a bunch of cans and bottles and shit in it. It's like I'm probably need I have emails to respond to [02:28:14] I have apologies to make like at me. It just represents everything [02:28:17] And there's a whole element, you know, that's related to kind of performance and being in pursuit of goals [02:28:22] I mean that there's a famous online lecture from admiral more craven former navy seal about make your bed first thing in the morning [02:28:29] And it's always been sold out make your bed because then you know that at least your bed is made when that night [02:28:33] No matter how bad things go. I think that's a minor effect for most people the maj\", \"fect for most people the major effect [02:28:37] Of military life and having a first step that involves something actionable in the world is also [02:28:43] One could imagine what you're not doing. You're not lying in bed thinking about all the things that are tormenting you [02:28:48] Being in forward action. Yeah also means you're not back on your heels quite as much that you're not going to wavering [02:28:55] So actions and behaviors send signals back to the nervous system hunch posture [02:29:00] Yes, but also forward action of any kind send signals back to your nervous system that you are in control of your environment [02:29:06] So and I think animals want that the reason your dog or horse can relax is because [02:29:12] It feels like it's in control enough control is in the environment [02:29:15] It's sort of the whole pack leader concept with dogs if you don't lead they will that's right because it makes them anxious [02:29:20] If you don't that's right people think oh, they're just really dominant [02:29:23] It's like no, you're actually not you but i'm referring to the the passive person. You're just too subordinate [02:29:28] They we all seek\", \" [02:29:28] They we all seek [02:29:30] Is it like mazlo's hierarchy of needs? We all seek these basic levels of autonomic comfort [02:29:35] Once we have that we can think about what's outside our media experience and be in pursuit of those goals [02:29:41] It makes people very confused when people ask me about dog training all the time and they're like [02:29:46] Well, I don't want to be mean and I don't it's like, you know, that's your shit. That's your codependent shit [02:29:51] You're projecting some other like work that out in therapy or whatever [02:29:54] But you know the more clear and stern and dominant you can be with your with your animal [02:29:59] This doesn't mean abusive. This doesn't mean hurting them or even touching them [02:30:02] But the more clear you are the safer they actually feel they feel less anxiety because as you said like they know [02:30:07] You're in charge like if you're regal if you're clear if you're direct [02:30:11] And if you say what you mean to mean what you say [02:30:13] They feel better because they know you're gonna handle shit right [02:30:17] I used to work with some at-risk kids and some non at-risk kids a\", \" and some non at-risk kids and it was incredible [02:30:20] they were adolescents and young teenagers and [02:30:23] It was amazing if we had rules they would resist [02:30:27] But these creative sides and more compatible sides like you know with each other would come out [02:30:32] If we didn't have rules they would start doing incredible risk-taking behavior [02:30:35] And we catch kids doing things that were just downright dangerous [02:30:38] So in the same way the animals are craving structure like structure makes us feel safe [02:30:42] I mean there it can be taken too far, right? [02:30:44] Then maybe the shoe like a little bit off center when I was a little bit much [02:30:47] But you know, and I I'm very proud. It was a high heel. That's why I'm very proud of having a lab operations manager [02:30:53] That is so meticulous like our safety. He hits hundreds on our safety inspections. You walk into our lab [02:30:58] You please don't eat off the floor of my lab, but but you could it's like he's that meticulous [02:31:03] And it makes everyone feel great because you feel safe because we work with a lot of dangerous stuff chemicals and things like t\", \" chemicals and things like that [02:31:09] So it's safety. It's just basic safety. And it's the thing that and I know that I I probably [02:31:14] Overthink, you know, you know, I love adages. I love aphorisms. I love [02:31:20] Generalizations they make me feel safe, you know, just to be able to throw a [02:31:24] Blanket on something every now and then even though I I know it's it's not always helpful or scientifically accurate [02:31:29] But something like the way you do anything is the way you do everything, you know [02:31:32] I tend to go there [02:31:34] Like if I'm in a relationship or a friendship or something and it's like if you do this one thing like if we're [02:31:40] Leaving starbucks and you leave the coffee cup on the top of the car and we pull out in the coffee spills [02:31:44] It's like well, what else are you sloppy about like if what else are you mindless and thoughtless about, you know [02:31:49] It's it's hard. It's hard for me to isolate one incident and not [02:31:53] Uh, sort of broadly paint my brush of the person's character because my brain goes and maybe this is just a [02:31:59] primordial [02:32:00] Thing are my you know \", \"2:00] Thing are my you know biology, but it's sort of like okay [02:32:04] Well, so how are you gonna parent a child if you can't figure out how to carry a fucking coffee cup? [02:32:07] Like I go I jump that far, you know, and [02:32:12] I hope people don't do that [02:32:14] with me, so I try to not do it too much with other people but I [02:32:18] I find it difficult to [02:32:21] um, you know [02:32:23] Not go there, but also there's a famous story about in uh green day in their writer for when they did concerts [02:32:28] they would ask for green m&m's like this is sort of um [02:32:33] Kind of a legend in entertainment and if there were green m&m's at the show [02:32:36] They knew everything else was right. It means they checked the speakers the like superstition [02:32:41] Yes, it's like one little thing because it's if you went out of your way to get these green m&m's [02:32:44] The way you do anything is the way you do everything now [02:32:45] I can trust all the other things you did [02:32:47] So if I walk in and the front part of your lab is clean, we now know the beakers are clean now [02:32:52] See I don't know meticulous. That's right. I k\", \"eticulous. That's right. I know that everything is fine [02:32:55] Yeah, the how you do one thing is how you do everything. I think is admirable. It's a little bit. Um, I mean if I may extreme [02:33:03] You know [02:33:04] My job requires that I do a few specific things very very well in order to continue to progress [02:33:09] Right. I have to raise money from my lab. I have to mentor people [02:33:12] I have to [02:33:13] oversee the science and build good experiments and make sure that we're meticulous about our analyses, etc [02:33:17] conclusions, etc [02:33:19] But if I attended to every little detail [02:33:22] At with the level of attention that I do to those things. I would truly never get anything done [02:33:27] So people like my postdoc advisor and my graduate advisor were extremely successful in particular my postdoc advisor [02:33:33] mostly because he [02:33:35] Didn't attend to anything else his home was filled with papers. It was a disaster. He didn't attend to his nutrition [02:33:40] It's there. So there are these kind of more lopsided ways of approaching things [02:33:44] But um, I admire people that have the how you do anything is h\", \"the how you do anything is how you do everything [02:33:48] I admire punctual people. Yeah, um [02:33:51] I you know, we're all reaching to do better. That's the I hope I would hope people understand the relationship between how [02:33:59] These things reflect a general state of being in the world that if you're sloppy about one thing [02:34:04] It's likely they might carry over. I know I mean it. Yeah, I don't know if it's fair or not necessarily [02:34:09] Maybe it's my fear [02:34:10] You know [02:34:11] Do is your do you ever get depressed that you know so much about all this [02:34:17] Like does it ever take the magic out of like the whimsical [02:34:21] I don't know life's amazing like [02:34:24] I love life [02:34:25] I just like are you are you have lows like anyone else or days I wake up and I'm like, uh, like I've got too many things coming at me [02:34:31] I don't you know, um [02:34:34] Do but I don't walk around putting a neurobiological lens [02:34:37] But you know that I I made a movie about a neurologist who [02:34:40] Like wouldn't surrender to being in love because she just like reduced it all to neurochemicals [02:34:45] Yeah, those ne\", \"ls [02:34:45] Yeah, those neurochemicals feel so good [02:34:48] So do you ever like like is it hard to be in a relationship because you're just like, oh, this is just me trying to not [02:34:54] Uh commit incest and you smell the right way [02:34:57] And this is me just trying to propagate and you're producing oxytocin. I don't I don't think about it [02:35:01] Does it ever take I think mate choice is a really interesting one. Yeah, I mean, I think that what's what's what's [02:35:07] What is your definition of love? I ask most of the guests this it would not be a neurobiological one [02:35:13] So there is a I have a different mode. I'm not in that mode in this moment where I switch my brain to just how things feel [02:35:19] I'm fascinated by [02:35:21] um [02:35:22] I think robert green is written about this by a kind of a seed of something in childhood [02:35:26] That drew us to something like I grew up. I have this absolute affinity at a visceral level to [02:35:34] Birds like tropical birds how animals and how they move I I mean when I was a kid [02:35:38] I used to get dropped off at the pet store and I would just like take notes on all the birds \", \"take notes on all the birds [02:35:42] You see, you know, I was like, I'm fascinated by animals and how they move [02:35:45] I'm fascinated by the natural world and so for me in that mode [02:35:50] It's all visceral. There's no analysis of it whatsoever [02:35:53] Now I can tell you that the you know, the elephant has a j-shaped pupil that allows you to [02:35:57] You know, visualize the tip of its trunk better than other things in the environment [02:36:00] I know the underlying biology dissected a few elephant eyes in my days [02:36:03] Elephants that were already deceased from natural causes mind you but [02:36:08] I don't walk around in an analytic mode [02:36:11] Unless I'm thinking about my work or how it might or things I see in the world [02:36:16] Definitely I look at some of those through a nerd scientific lens [02:36:20] But in general when I'm in an experience, it's just I want to be as purely [02:36:26] With that experience and not intellectualizing it at all [02:36:29] But I will say an intellectual the word intellectual is badly misunderstood [02:36:33] An intellectual you're an intellectual [02:36:36] I just feel like fighting with you i\", \"eel like fighting with you is such a nightmare [02:36:39] So an intellectual you're like, well, you're actually using that word wrong [02:36:42] An intellectual is somebody that can appreciate something and knows a lot about it at [02:36:47] Multiple levels of granularity like from a very top contour all the way down to the tiny details [02:36:53] Your understanding of comedy. I mean about Joe like his understanding of martial arts is like it's amazing, right? [02:36:58] Like it's it's vast [02:37:00] But he's not going to talk about it to me the same way he's going to talk about it to another fighter because [02:37:04] He understands it multiple levels of granularity [02:37:06] I'm going to talk differently among scientists as I do the general public [02:37:10] so we tend to demonize the word intellectual but [02:37:14] Part of being having an intellectual orientation in life is knowing when to turn off the analytic side [02:37:20] And just being in the experience [02:37:22] If you want a real and accurate data assessment of how I am in relationship because that's what you've asked me several times now [02:37:29] I can give you some I can give you some \", \"ou some I can give you some references and you can get there and no [02:37:33] It's not harassment. You can you can get there assessment. I have been told. I want phone number. Yeah, I mean [02:37:38] I want email. Here's what I won't do under any circumstances in any relationship of any kind [02:37:43] I won't be recruited [02:37:45] Into somebody else's emotional state simply to validate that state and because you talked about this the other day [02:37:52] Is that it called emotional contagion? Yeah emotional contagion or projection like [02:37:57] There are people that when they feel something they don't like they have to do what's called evacutive projection [02:38:03] They're angry. They're agitated. So they scream at you. I'm not going to jump on the titanic with you [02:38:07] They scream at you and guess what let's say I do that now. Let's just use me as the bad example. Okay. All right, so [02:38:13] Um, someone in the room says something or you say something mean I'm angry. Yeah, all right [02:38:18] So then I get all stirred up and you're calm and it's upsetting me even more yell. I start laughing [02:38:23] Right. So so my internal [02:38:25]\", \"So so my internal [02:38:25] So my internal metronome is going faster and faster and yours is going slower and it's making me even more angry [02:38:30] The difference between us as I say the delta for the nerds out there is getting greater and greater [02:38:36] So [02:38:37] Not consciously but through some sort of learning in childhood. I now scream at you or I say something really cruel [02:38:43] Where I bring up some I'm not going to do that now you're triggered and guess what I feel calmer [02:38:49] I feel like I got one over on you. I feel why because now we're matched in terms of our level of autonomic arousal [02:38:55] Both screaming right now if you're angry at me and you're screaming at me, let's put you in the bad [02:38:59] That operator position and I'm like I hear you [02:39:03] Exactly exactly. So why is that so awful? You have to move your shoulders when you do it. Did I do that? You're like, I hear you [02:39:11] all right, well [02:39:13] So [02:39:14] It's going to be really angry and frustrating to you because I'm not getting I'm sounds like you're mocking [02:39:19] I'm not I know you can because you know at an intuitive level [0\", \"now at an intuitive level [02:39:23] I'm not really I might be hearing you with my ears, but I'm not really understanding [02:39:27] I'm not matching you and humans create crave crave [02:39:31] humans crave [02:39:33] this [02:39:35] Matching of energy mirroring or something. Yeah, they crave a matching of autonomic arousal [02:39:40] Which is really just to say a level of alertness, you know, they they we feel comfortable when people are in sync with us [02:39:46] Yeah, and some of this online [02:39:47] I'm saying this and I'm realizing I've been thinking about this for the last few minutes [02:39:50] Like some of this online behavior [02:39:52] Could reflect the fact that people are really frustrated and pissed off [02:39:56] And they want other people to be pissed off frustrated and it's they don't even know they're doing it [02:40:00] I think a lot of times this isn't conscious [02:40:04] Look, I'm speculating a lot, but projection is a real thing. Yeah, so, you know borderline personalities [02:40:10] We have splitting there's projection, you know, evacutive expression is [02:40:16] Is very destructive. It's the kind of thing that it's an attempt \", \" thing that it's an attempt to recruit other people [02:40:20] I'm very disappointed with the statement. No one can make us feel anything. That's ridiculous [02:40:25] We can make other people feel things the idea that you're going to be completely [02:40:28] People say that no one can make you feel [02:40:31] No one can make you feel anything. It's ridiculous. There are the nervous system integrates. What's on the outside? [02:40:36] Alex Jones, who are you hanging out with? [02:40:38] Who's that? [02:40:42] I don't know. Sorry [02:40:44] You are such an alien [02:40:47] I'm sorry [02:40:49] This is the opposite of a red flag. We talk a lot about red flags on the show [02:40:53] No, alex jones is like a very alt right like fake news. Okay. I don't get into [02:40:58] He's a conspiracy there. I have political opinions. I just don't voice. Yeah, no, neither do it neither dry [02:41:02] But it's that to me is such a fake bullshit [02:41:07] Fake self-help like no one can make you feel anything like oh, yeah, no one can hurt you without your consent [02:41:12] Like that's just like fake. Yeah, there's it's not grounded in it. It's not grounded in any um rea\", \"s not grounded in any um reality [02:41:18] That that you might be a psychopath, but that's yeah, I'll put that with flatter. Yeah [02:41:23] Not true [02:41:24] Right, but I think it gives people a false sense of empowerment for like a femoral empowerment [02:41:28] Like yeah, no one can make me feel anything [02:41:30] But then you just are going to feel ashamed and disappointed in yourself when that not ends up being false [02:41:35] I mean their entire online platforms and people whose entire careers are based on how badly they've been triggered [02:41:42] And I'm not talking traumatized because I have real sensitivity for people that have been [02:41:46] Legitimately traumatized, but it's all about trick being triggered and triggering other people as a form of emotional contagion and recruitment [02:41:53] The more autonomically aroused people are the easier it is to recruit them into happiness and joy. I think a great concert or into [02:42:00] Rallying and anger. I mean this is the these mechanisms because they're so embedded in our deep neurology have been around for [02:42:07] Tens of thousands of years and people are still using them now. They'\", \" still using them now. They're just using them in slightly more sophisticated ways [02:42:12] So I'm screaming at you and so what so either way you're screwed if you say I hear you [02:42:19] There's probably you gave a good example of a of an adaptive response adaptive meaning good for both people [02:42:25] Which was okay. I hear you saying that you're really angry about blank blank and blank [02:42:30] You know like no that wasn't articulated exactly the way that I'm thinking and I'm like, okay [02:42:34] Well, you know that kind of thing. Yeah, I think I think um, you can say go for a walk [02:42:39] Yeah, although some people this is interesting because I've observed this in trauma release community [02:42:44] Sometimes when two people are confronting a traumatic thing. Yeah, and someone says I I need a walk. Yeah [02:42:49] They're leaving triggers the other person. Yeah, it feels abandoned. And so this is a whole [02:42:53] There's a whole world of very talented and I have to say if there's a community that I've been exposed to that has just [02:42:59] tremendous [02:43:01] good intentions and and [02:43:04] You know putting their efforts in the r\", \"tting their efforts in the right place is this trauma release community [02:43:07] I'm talking about skilled [02:43:09] Qualified certified people doing trauma release trying to bring people to a better relationship with the things that have hurt them and the people [02:43:15] They've hurt them. Yeah, it's an incredible community of people making that effort and humans. There's just now 2020 [02:43:21] Trying to figure out how all this works and where neuroscience might play a role [02:43:25] Um, EMDR changed my life. EMDR breathing. Um, there's just so much happening right now [02:43:32] That's really exciting. Um, I [02:43:35] It's interesting because I I have on my list of things to ask you about like the [02:43:39] Sort of neurology of shot and froida like why we get some kind of sick [02:43:44] enjoyment out of other people's embarrassment, you know, is that the german word for like, you know [02:43:49] Um, and is that our way of the same way that we get? [02:43:53] Uh, serotonin from gossiping because it helps us, you know, collect information on social mores and how we should behave [02:44:00] You know, it's kind of the same. Yeah when I see someb\", \" same. Yeah when I see somebody not [02:44:03] Performing well, I feel like really embarrassed. So do I I do not feel I get no, but why do we think it's like probably more [02:44:11] Instead of like if a ice skater falls, it's the worst thing. I I just I can't handle it [02:44:16] I can hardly even watch gymnastics because if someone falls just like it's it's too upsetting for me [02:44:22] But when someone slips on a banana, it's the if someone falls and doesn't get hurt [02:44:26] There's also nothing funnier [02:44:28] Yeah, humor is an interesting one. There's a little bit of neuroscience and [02:44:32] quality cognitive psychology on [02:44:35] Humor and humor is often just the unexpected thing [02:44:39] Or where I feel like the comedian is leading me down a path and I'm thinking. Oh, no, they're not really gonna go there [02:44:46] So it's raising my level of kind of autonomic or I was like, oh goodness [02:44:49] And then they might pivot or whatever. I haven't spent a lot of time [02:44:52] Well now I've spent some time, you know, I did joe's podcast and now with you [02:44:56] I think comedians are really interesting because they have a [02:44:\", \" because they have a [02:44:58] They know how to construct linear things. They can build things that are linear [02:45:02] But they also know how to put these these tweaks. They look at the world differently [02:45:06] You know to be creative, you got to look at the world differently [02:45:08] So I can't really comment too much on what's known because I don't think there's a lot known [02:45:13] But it is a beautiful example of the creative process of taking existing elements [02:45:18] I mean you have the english language [02:45:20] For you and you can organize it in ways that are trivial, boring, disappointing or hilarious [02:45:26] Based on just the associations with those words [02:45:29] It's really an amazing thing when you think about it and it speaks to just how powerful the relationship between language and emotions is [02:45:36] I um close friend of mine. He's the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF Eddie Chang [02:45:40] He's a world expert in in speech and language and he he told me about a discovery [02:45:45] Um, I think it's from his lab or maybe a neighboring lab [02:45:48] It's kind of interesting that our representation of our hands and han\", \"ntation of our hands and hand motion [02:45:52] Is actually right next to the representation in the brain of speech and language [02:45:56] And this is because humans speak some people more than others the italians in particular use their hands [02:46:02] To speak we annunciate and we accentuate with our hands [02:46:06] And so these are primitive forms of expression that have been lumped together [02:46:10] And so I think comedians are somehow the physical comedy all that I think it's a vast space [02:46:14] I wish there was more neuroscience on this but anyway, it's kind of fun to take a little bit [02:46:17] Perhaps what we've talked about today. You just kind of cast that lens on comedy [02:46:21] Maybe a discussion for another time. And I think it's important important for people. Stop trying to wrap this up [02:46:25] Uh, I think it's important for people to [02:46:28] um, you know look at uh, you know, this is going to feel like a weird curveball [02:46:33] But like acting they say um great actors [02:46:36] Uh, you can tell what they're thinking with the sound off [02:46:39] You know, so when I think about myself communicating with somebody [02:4\", \"nicating with somebody [02:46:43] If if you took words out of the equation [02:46:46] How would I be coming off to the person you because sometimes what we say and how we say it [02:46:50] Contradict each other and we're like, I don't understand why you think I'm yelling at you [02:46:53] You know, like I'm totally fine. What you're saying and how you're saying it or contradictory [02:46:56] And we're always going to default to how you're saying it not what you're actually saying [02:46:59] You know, it's just so much communication being nonverbal. I just feel like there's so much [02:47:05] um [02:47:06] distressed caused by that uh [02:47:10] Lack of congruence between what we're saying and how we're saying it and the confusion that it causes in kids [02:47:15] Seeing my mom is saying she's fine, but she seems really stressed out [02:47:17] I know I'm doubting my own reality and now I can't trust women and now I'm confused and you know [02:47:22] So for me because I grew up and um with very indirect communication all the time [02:47:26] It took me a really long time to understand uh [02:47:30] To be able to trust what somebody says we are very tuned in\", \"dy says we are very tuned into [02:47:35] other people's level of autonomic [02:47:38] Sort of alertness or calmness and timbre of voice is one of the most powerful [02:47:44] Ways that we communicate. Oh, wow [02:47:45] So it remember the the neurons in the brain that control size are right next to the ones that control laughing and crying [02:47:52] An animal crying in pain. Sorry to bring up such an intense example [02:47:57] Yeah, is exactly that you just you just I don't want to say prove my point because I'm not here to prove points [02:48:03] But you that response embodies the point I'm trying to make which is that an animal crying or wailing in pain [02:48:10] A human wailing in pain recruits an emotional state in us [02:48:14] And in the same way if you grew up in a home where you heard certain kinds of vocalizations that were anger [02:48:21] Actually, I'll give an example. I was at this trauma release thing [02:48:23] I was observing and trying to think about how we might export some tools from my lab to that community and vice versa [02:48:29] And a woman said she said look [02:48:31] I've enjoyed our interactions and I'm really glad you're h\", \"and I'm really glad you're here [02:48:34] But like I'm really afraid of you because your voice reminds me of my dad and I was like [02:48:39] I'm sorry and she said but it has nothing to do with the way your your actual voice [02:48:43] It's just something about the the resonant frequency of your voice just freaks me out [02:48:47] And it was and I was like well, there's nothing I can do about that much, right? But [02:48:51] You know opera singers again [02:48:53] They tell me because again been spending time with them that their goal is to get the audience sometimes the experienced ones [02:49:00] Their goal is to get the audience feeling in their diaphragm what they feel [02:49:05] So establishing a resonant frequency literally a frequency of vibration [02:49:09] So that the person in the audience feels the sadness or anticipation or the elation that they feel [02:49:15] Not by what they're hearing with their ears alone by actually vibrating now [02:49:19] It sounds very like woo, but the phrenic nerve firing and the diaphragm vibrating at the same frequency [02:49:26] We are on the same frequency and that's going to be done through sound waves now a\", \"ne through sound waves now animals do this [02:49:31] So fish have a lateral line that senses electricity. They can sense electric fields in the water [02:49:37] Right the platypus senses electric fields with its built [02:49:40] They can sense where things are but also the energies of those things, right? [02:49:45] Are am I being pursued by a predator? [02:49:48] Am I next to other fish that are [02:49:52] A fish like me, right? Is it a fish that wants to mate or a fish that wants to fight? [02:49:56] Is it a fish that wants to bump me out of the way to mate with the fish next to me? [02:49:59] This is what animals do, but they feel it in their body [02:50:02] Humans we tend to overemphasize the content of speech. This is why online [02:50:07] The visceral part in the intention is completely lost. It's like stripped down. So [02:50:12] Anyway, we can since we were talking about relationships earlier [02:50:16] You still haven't given me your definition of love [02:50:18] All right, I'll do that right now [02:50:20] Do you have one? [02:50:21] Where the average resonant frequency now I'm kidding me [02:50:25] Is similar [02:50:27] You know, I'm a sort o\", \"0:27] You know, I'm a sort of half-kidding because there are couples that when you're around them [02:50:31] I have one friend in particular and his wife. They just have a new newborn son [02:50:35] He's about one now and they're delightful people [02:50:38] Their son is delightful. He's just such a cool little kid and when they're together [02:50:44] It's almost like everything just gets better for them and everyone around them [02:50:48] It's like you just feel good and it's not about what they're saying [02:50:51] It's not about how they touch each other or do anything like who knows what they do behind closed doors [02:50:55] None of my business. I don't want to know [02:50:57] But it just feels good to be around them because you can tell they just feel great as a unit [02:51:02] And I kind of hold them in my mind is kind of the the best example of like not because they have a [02:51:06] Kid is not what's about but like love. It's just sort of they bring out the best [02:51:10] We hear these phrases definition and they seem to do [02:51:14] They seem to do very well when they're together or apart [02:51:18] I see a lot of people that are like they ha\", \"people that are like they have to be like this. Yeah, or they have to be like this [02:51:23] I think everybody's different for everybody. It's like interdependent. But yeah, it is a case by case thing [02:51:27] I think so and I think their temperaments are just very well matched [02:51:31] You know, I I look at people more or less as different species of animals individuals, you know, and [02:51:37] They're whatever species match they are is just a good [02:51:40] But are you because I find myself sometimes the more I learn about this the more I start going like, okay [02:51:45] Of course, I have a crush on this person. I'm releasing oxytocin and dopamine and [02:51:50] Oh god, if we have sex and I'll have then I'll be attached to the person [02:51:52] Like I find myself trying to check if their shoes are all [02:51:56] Trying to like hack my own brain. You know sometimes so one of the one of the [02:52:01] Greatest and worst features of the human brain is that it can think about itself [02:52:05] Yeah, yeah, so [02:52:08] That third person is great and can be very adaptive or it can interfere with just feeling in the [02:52:15] Feeling what we're feel\", \":15] Feeling what we're feeling. I'm not I'm not criticizing your response to that situation [02:52:19] You're welcome and I don't think we're just a bag of chemicals [02:52:22] I think that we all should learn something about the chemicals [02:52:25] But we should also learn to recognize the states in our mind and body [02:52:30] That we like and that we dislike and we should ask ourselves in a very direct way [02:52:35] Do I like it for good reasons adaptive reasons or do I like it for maladaptive reasons? [02:52:41] Are we supposed to go to sleep and wake up with the sun? [02:52:44] Not necessarily sunrise and sunset, but one of the most powerful things one can do for their mental and physical health is to view the sun [02:52:52] With the eyes sunglasses off unless you have a retinal degenerative condition [02:52:57] For two to ten minutes first thing in the morning. You don't have to watch the sunrise [02:53:01] But while what it's called low solar angle and the sun isn't overhead yet [02:53:05] So sometime before 10 a.m. Or so noon if you slept in just do it anyway [02:53:10] It triggers the cortisol and melt melatonin pathways in the brain and body\", \"thways in the brain and body to be in the right rhythms [02:53:16] And then we definitely want to avoid really bright lights of any color [02:53:20] From the hours of about 11 p.m. To 4 a.m. Wow [02:53:23] Blue light glasses. We talk about a lot of the pod. I've convinced everyone to buy them. Did they always? [02:53:28] They're funny [02:53:30] I think it's a good idea for people to avoid bright lights in the evening and night and blue [02:53:35] Blue blockers are one way to filter out bright light [02:53:40] By where you can still see you can still function safely. You can't really drive with sunglasses at night [02:53:45] But you could wear blue blockers. I think I don't know. I don't I personally don't wear them [02:53:49] I just dim the lights in my home at night. But what about on your phone? [02:53:52] I've texted you at odd hours of the night. Yeah, so you want to [02:53:56] Dim the screen on your phone as much as possible [02:53:58] And you also want the lights low in your physical environment literally not overhead because the neurons in the eye that [02:54:04] That send signals to the brain to wake up are located in the lower portion of the ey\", \" the lower portion of the eye [02:54:08] Which means they look up in the visual field [02:54:11] So I I always say the single best thing anyone can do for their mental and physical health [02:54:16] Is get some bright sunlight in their eyes in the morning [02:54:19] If there's cloud cover you're still getting a lot more light than you'd ever get from an artificial light [02:54:24] And if you're in the depths of winter in Scandinavia, you might want to get an artificial light to do that [02:54:29] But for the most part sunlight will do it and then at night [02:54:34] You want to avoid bright lights from about 11 p.m. To 4 a.m [02:54:38] Of all colors wear blue blockers if that's in your practice some people get you know headaches and migraines [02:54:42] We could talk I know you talked about migraine [02:54:45] The same cells in the eye that set our circadian clocks and tell us when to wake up and when to sleep [02:54:50] Have a connection from the eye to an area of the brain [02:54:53] That's in the thalamus called the anterior thalamus the anterior nucleus of the thalamus [02:54:57] That then projects the meninges which are the it's like the thick tissu\", \"he it's like the thick tissue that the brain is housed in [02:55:03] You take off the skull and you look at a brain you think it's just brain there [02:55:06] There's actually some stuff that looks like saran wrap. Yeah. Yeah, but to get through that saran wrap [02:55:10] This stuff is tough. This stuff is like you have to like really get through [02:55:13] I've had to cut through a lot of this stuff in my lifetime and it's really thick fibrous tissue [02:55:18] This area of the brain [02:55:20] Projects there and it can cause [02:55:23] Photophobia and headache. So yeah, a lot of bright lights. Yes [02:55:26] Then the blue blockers might be good for you because you can't wear sunglasses indoors [02:55:30] So you want to get a lot of bright light in your eyes during the day? [02:55:33] You obviously never want to look at any light that's so bright that it hurts because it can damage your retina [02:55:37] You don't want I'm not talking about like staring at the sun, you know, that would damage your eye, but [02:55:42] Through a window. It's 50 fold weaker [02:55:45] So try and get outside to do this even if briefly and then in the at night avoid bright l\", \" the at night avoid bright lights or wear the blue blockers [02:55:52] migraine, yeah, I've I've [02:55:53] Finally at a point in my life where I'm not debilitated by migraines every couple months [02:55:57] But I remember going to the er at cedar is like when I was like 22 and I got migraines my whole life [02:56:02] Like when I was a kid, I was the one that ruined every field trip. I was the one that you know [02:56:06] Ruin the disneyland trip. I was the one that like got the migraine and everybody had to like, you know [02:56:10] Deal with me and drive me home and I couldn't be in light and I'd be puking [02:56:13] And I couldn't see in the left side of my [02:56:15] Um body would go numb and wow like extreme like super super intense. And there's a lot of things that I have done [02:56:22] I have just a list of of um like a list [02:56:26] Um that I send people when they say they have migraines [02:56:28] I wrote all about it and I have a whole chapter on it in my book [02:56:31] But the first thing I always say is just wear sunglasses outside all the time [02:56:34] Um and get your vision checked because that's like one of the main triggers for migr\", \"f the main triggers for migraines is like squinting triggering [02:56:40] So blue light glasses I wear all the time [02:56:42] Um grinding at night is a big one like the lactic acid you produce from grinding at night in your muscles [02:56:47] And a couple of things that I've heard [02:56:50] Migraine doctors tell me over the years is that the migraine brain likes routine [02:56:55] It wants the same uh neurochemicals every day at the same time every day all the time [02:56:59] So it doesn't matter really what you eat [02:57:01] If you are allergic to sugar or gluten or whatever i'm sure dairy is not super helpful [02:57:06] But whatever you eat or drink uh eat at the same time every day basically [02:57:11] Yeah, so the three ways that um so every cell in our body has a clock [02:57:15] Runs at 24 hours, which is not coincidentally [02:57:18] In sync with the 24 hour spin of the earth once every cycle is not kind of like blue biologists [02:57:23] Like every cell has a genetic program to have a 24 hour clock needs to be synchronized all those clocks need to be synchronized [02:57:29] The only way we can synchronize those clocks is with light information\", \"ks is with light information delivered to the eyes not light on the skin [02:57:35] That's a whole nother business, but [02:57:37] That's why the eyes are outside your head outside your skull [02:57:40] That's why these two pieces of brain are outside your skull to inform the rest of your [02:57:44] Body and when it's night and when it's daytime [02:57:47] We have lungs because we need all our cells need oxygen [02:57:51] So we bring air into our lungs and then it goes to the bloodstream and distributes [02:57:54] We need light information for all the cells in our body [02:57:57] We do that by bringing them in through these things we call eyes and then it's distributed to all the cells of the body [02:58:02] The light doesn't permeate. It's sent through electrical signals and neurons and chemicals [02:58:06] So getting that sunlight early in the morning is absolutely key. The next way you do it is with [02:58:12] Feeding time and exercise activity rhythms. So if you travel to japan, let's say and you're totally jet lag [02:58:18] It takes a few days to catch up to the local pattern [02:58:21] But if you eat on the local schedule, you switch faster [02:58\", \"le, you switch faster [02:58:24] If you exercise when people are active and you sleep when people are sleeping [02:58:29] You know, you're trying to sleep when people are sleeping you'll shift much much quicker [02:58:32] So but light is the quickest way to set these rhythms without question [02:58:36] A lot of people are jet lagged at home, especially now what they're indoors. Yes, so they're like I feel miserable [02:58:41] I'm just so I'm depressed. I'm anxious. Well, you're jet lagged except you're jet lagging yourself in your apartment or home [02:58:47] I have so many more questions for you. I can do a more rapid fire if you want. No, we're gonna do [02:58:51] I'm gonna make you do this again. I'm gonna force you and I will publicly attack you if you don't [02:58:56] Okay, the last last last last thing I'm asking I swear [02:58:59] is about ancestral trauma [02:59:02] And there's something called family constellation, which I know is thought of as like complete like [02:59:07] Fui [02:59:08] But there is something to me to and I don't know if it's nature and nurture [02:59:14] Family consolation is when you sort of learn about the trauma of your an\", \" about the trauma of your ancestors and learn what [02:59:18] Fears and phobias you've perhaps inherited heights is something that I my guess is universal [02:59:24] Some are more afraid than others. There was that study where mice [02:59:29] You might have actually done this study where mice [02:59:32] Got electrocuted every time they smelled cherry blossoms and they're offspring when they smelled cherry blossoms would recoil [02:59:39] Babies are afraid of pictures of spiders. Even they don't consciously know what a spider is, you know, these things that [02:59:44] were sort of [02:59:46] Wired to be afraid of and how it's kind of specific [02:59:49] to people my [02:59:52] Ancestry goes back to west virginia to coal mines and [02:59:57] You know, whether this is just family lore or legend or whatever like we're all [03:00:01] Kind of claustrophobic and big banging sounds and sort of we all have misophonia and sort of, you know, which [03:00:07] Our theory is that it has to do with our ancestors being in coal mines and mine explosions and stuff like that [03:00:12] I just I'm curious if there's any science to the family constellation [03:00:16] well, t\", \"tellation [03:00:16] well, there's some emerging evidence that [03:00:19] um [03:00:20] Learning can be inherited and these you know, the original experiments were done in these like these little flatworms [03:00:26] They're those like really boring species [03:00:27] But I guess if you like flatworms, they're really interesting [03:00:29] But where they would shock them and then their offspring would respond to shock [03:00:34] Like they would learn to kind of have lovian responses to things even though the babies had never been exposed to that [03:00:40] so [03:00:41] um [03:00:42] Sort of transgenerational trauma in worms of all things and then there's some recent studies in mice like the cherry blossom study [03:00:48] um [03:00:49] That some of this could be inherited mice [03:00:52] Here's what we know for sure [03:00:54] We inherit genes from [03:00:56] mom and dad [03:00:57] However, those genes are subject to what we call epigenetic regulation [03:01:01] So some of that epigenetic regulation can be in utero. So if our mom was really stressed, right? [03:01:07] It can cause release of for instance, um, the the adrenals the adrenal glands can rele\", \" the adrenal glands can release testosterone too [03:01:13] it can like [03:01:14] Can masculinize fetuses if it's really extreme but under kind of more normal conditions if like mom is really stressed [03:01:20] The baby might come out more aggressive because it has more more testosterone exposure during development things like that [03:01:28] There's um [03:01:30] There's also some really interesting stuff on what's called genomic imprinting [03:01:34] We love the idea that we get half our genes from mom and half from dad [03:01:38] And you know parents will always say oh, that's exactly like you and that's exactly like you or that's like [03:01:42] I'm being exactly like my dad or exactly like my mom turns out [03:01:46] There's a woman at Harvard named Catherine Doolock and she had a postdoc named chris greg who's now at the University of Utah [03:01:51] And there are others who have done beautiful studies showing that in the brain [03:01:54] there are some cells that [03:01:56] Are genetically identical to mom and mom only or dad and dad only [03:02:03] So there are parts of your brain that very likely are genetically identical to one parent or the \", \"ntical to one parent or the other [03:02:09] So the idea that we're just a mix of both parents [03:02:11] First of all that's falling away. I think the modern genetics tells us this that's probably not true [03:02:17] What's hardwired and what's learned that seems to be a kind of general theme running through everything today? [03:02:21] And it's a it's a it's a wonderful theme because it's the most interesting theme in all of neuroscience really because it embodies everything but [03:02:30] Here's what we know for sure if [03:02:33] A series of grandparents and parents and children are stressed in a particular way [03:02:40] The hormones and the neurochemicals that are secreted could have a very profound influence on [03:02:45] Those offspring we know that there is for instance influenza in the first trimester if the mom gets a flu [03:02:52] Can [03:02:53] predispose the offspring to certain kinds of neurologic issues later [03:02:57] Now does that mean that every woman that gets flu during our first trimester is going to have a child that somehow messed up? [03:03:03] No, of course not [03:03:04] But it shifts the bias towards more probability that th\", \"rds more probability that there will be these neurologic syndromes. So [03:03:11] Immune infection, you know immune compromise or infection [03:03:15] Trauma it's all translated into chemical responses in the body. And so I do think that offspring can inherit some of this stuff [03:03:22] I um [03:03:23] I meant to raise this earlier. So I'll just kind of [03:03:26] I'll add to this topic something that's very related [03:03:28] I think it's useful for people to if they're thinking about their brain and their nervous system to think about [03:03:32] What's non-negotiable and what's negotiable? What's unique to the individual and what's inherited? [03:03:38] And I think vision provides a beautiful example. So [03:03:41] The biologists tornton weasel and david huble [03:03:45] Um, they discovered these periods of critical period plasticity won the Nobel prize for that [03:03:50] They also won the Nobel prize for showing that [03:03:53] The cells the neurons in the eye respond to little circles. That's the only thing they see the world is a bunch of little circles to the eye [03:04:01] That information is then passed to the brain [03:04:04] Where those litt\", \" [03:04:04] Where those little circles are aligned into little lines [03:04:07] So everyone kind of constructs a kind of outline of everything they look at all animals do this [03:04:13] Humans are very dependent on facial expressions. So all humans have a face area [03:04:18] Some people like my postdoc advisor were terrible at recognizing faces. Some people are phenomenal at looking at faces [03:04:25] That's right, but everyone has neurons that respond to these little dots these little lines and faces some people better than others [03:04:32] That's all true. That's all non-negotiable across our species [03:04:37] But then it starts to get into some really interesting nuance [03:04:39] There was a study that was published in nature a few years ago asking a kind of classic question in neuroscience [03:04:44] That relates directly to what you're asking, which is [03:04:47] Do we have what are called grandmother cells? Do we have neurons in our brain that represent [03:04:52] My grandmother for me and your grandmother for you in particular not all grandmothers [03:04:56] But your grandmother my grandmother and it's amazing because it turns out that peopl\", \"ause it turns out that people have these cells [03:05:02] I have a neuron in my brain that when it fires [03:05:05] I think of my grandmother or I see an image of her in my mind's eye [03:05:09] Okay, when I look at a picture of her that neuron fires [03:05:13] There's a sort of funny but not so but really important aspect to this study [03:05:17] Which was that they brought in a subject that were showing them lots of different faces [03:05:21] And they're this subject unlike all the other subjects had a neuron that only responded to the face of jennifer aniston [03:05:30] Neuroscientists know about these about this discovery was published in the journal nature [03:05:33] Which is our kind of super bowl of publishing very very stringent journal very high quality journal [03:05:39] Maybe the most high quality and stringent journal. So this particular subject [03:05:43] I don't recall if the subject was male or female [03:05:45] Has a neuron in their head assuming the subject is still alive [03:05:48] They're walking around out there and when they think about jennifer aniston that neuron and only that neuron and maybe a few other neurons around it [03:05:5\", \"r neurons around it [03:05:55] Is electrically active [03:05:57] When that neuron is electrically active, they think of jennifer aniston. They see her in their minds eye [03:06:02] So does that mean that everyone has a cell that represents jennifer aniston? No [03:06:07] In fact, if I'm talking about someone right now named jennifer aniston and you don't know who that is [03:06:11] Which is a seems like a seems like a pretty low probability event [03:06:14] But if there's somebody out there is like who is he talking about they don't have such a cell [03:06:19] So what this means is that everybody's brain has certain things that are common to all of us [03:06:24] And everybody's brain has real estate and neurons that are tuned specifically to their unique experience [03:06:31] Okay, so I have a jennifer aniston cell right [03:06:34] Because you know who she is if you close your eyes you can imagine who she is and what she looks like [03:06:38] You probably even see it as I'm saying this that means for sure that you have a representation of jennifer aniston [03:06:43] In your head as the firing of neurons in a particular sequence. Yes, but is it one little\", \"e. Yes, but is it one little cell? [03:06:49] It's probably a collection of cells and it doesn't spell jennifer aniston [03:06:55] But there's I'm fascinated by like, you know how when you think of someone like one visual comes up of them [03:07:01] Like that it that's right, you know [03:07:03] And the reason for that is really interesting [03:07:05] The reason for that is that these cells in our visual cortex as it's called this face area [03:07:10] Have direct connections to the areas of the brain that we call the limbic system. They're involved in emotion [03:07:15] So let's say someone was really awful to you. Yeah [03:07:19] You have neurons that are strongly connected to the neurons that convey a sense of awfulness [03:07:23] And you will never forget their face or their voice or they're anything [03:07:27] Yes [03:07:27] People that are kind of neutral you walk past people all the time on the street [03:07:31] You see people online all the time you will never need to know them and your brain just throws out that [03:07:35] But that's our reptilian brain's way of saying remember this person. They're dangerous. They're scary [03:07:39] Right. So wh\", \"cary [03:07:39] Right. So what people seem to overlook in the discussion of neuroscience is that typically overlook in the discussion of neuroscience is that [03:07:47] These lizard brain areas and these higher areas. They are intimately connected. They're direct [03:07:53] What we call monosynaptic direct connections. It's not like you have to go through three or four different stations, right? [03:07:58] It's like new york to la flight. It's direct [03:08:01] The primitive areas of our brain are linked to the more sophisticated areas of our brain [03:08:06] They're not so separate and so it shouldn't come as a surprise that when you think about something kind of neutral [03:08:11] Or somebody, you know, it's like, yeah, you see somebody who's really triggering [03:08:14] Or that you like very much and and it's instantaneous [03:08:17] It captures a whole bunch of your neural circuitry and maybe even a response in your body [03:08:21] I won't ask you if you know the jen for aniston [03:08:24] Example captures a response in your body or not, but there you just smiled jealousy. So there you go [03:08:29] So it's linked to something [03:08:30] It's linked \", \"hing [03:08:30] It's linked to something and so I raise this example a because there's experimental evidence in a very rigorous [03:08:36] laboratory study [03:08:37] But what it means is really important. It means that yes, we have a map of our own unique experience in our minds [03:08:43] We're each showing up to the table [03:08:45] With a different toolkit with a different filter and a different way of looking at things [03:08:50] But there are a lot of things the chemicals [03:08:52] And the deeper circuits in particular the limbic system and the hypothalamus that are universal [03:08:57] And that's why putrid things [03:09:00] Smell gross and why we avoid them and you know, unless we have some weird, you know proclivity for them [03:09:05] How do you have so much energy? [03:09:07] And oh, you get tired. I thought it was a scientific question. It always takes me a second [03:09:12] Sure, I sleep very well. Um, I definitely I do that yoga nidra thing usually [03:09:17] Um, I think you're seeing a lot of energy because I love this topic [03:09:20] I love I mean jen for aniston is great too, but I but what I mean [03:09:24] I'm super excited when I th\", \" I'm super excited when I think about no, I think neuroscience in general [03:09:27] Yeah, I just you know, I feel so blessed. I feel like I'm a brain explorer. That's what I do [03:09:31] I spend a lot of time in looking around in physical brains recording from physical brains and talking and thinking about the brain and nervous system [03:09:37] And for me, it was it was just um [03:09:41] You know, I teach your anatomy. I see this beautiful. Yeah, you know, I look at a brain and I go, oh my god [03:09:45] That's amazing. Like look at the olfactory bulbs on that hyena or whatever. So to me, it's [03:09:50] It's thrilling, but I think I don't know. It's probably how you feel when you do comedy [03:09:53] It's like, you know, I think I'm um, yeah, I've got infinite energy for it. Who knows [03:09:58] There are other topics that just put me to sleep right away. Do you like doing podcasts? [03:10:01] I've enjoyed this one a lot. Yeah, and I've laughed a lot, which has been a lot of questions for me [03:10:07] Loads of questions [03:10:09] Do you have any questions for me about neurology? [03:10:11] Ask me any question. Let's see if I could answer it [03:10\", \" if I could answer it [03:10:14] Uh, really? Yeah. Do you want to do like 10 questions in neurology? [03:10:17] Let's just like test my knowledge of oh goodness. Okay. Um [03:10:22] Um, uh, what does amygdala mean? [03:10:25] Oh, like what is it the fear center of the brain that oh, no, not what does it do? [03:10:28] What does it mean? Why is it called amygdala amygdala means? [03:10:34] Scared almond [03:10:40] All right, let's try another one [03:10:43] I'm used to giving examples. Let's try another one. I actually did know that what is that in my I need to have been [03:10:48] Traumatized when I learned that for it to have [03:10:50] While eating. Um, yeah [03:10:53] Uh, what does hippocampus mean? [03:10:56] Think about the shape. I'll give you a hint [03:10:58] Looks like a hippo seahorse, but close. Ah, but not quite so. Okay. Um, let's think of another one. Um [03:11:06] This is like the etymology of neurology terms. Let's see. Um [03:11:12] Oh, goodness [03:11:16] Do I get a moment to think of course is a podcast so it's like it's the times [03:11:20] Yeah, no, please people stick with us. They're loyal [03:11:25] Right, um, you're trying to thi\", \"ht, um, you're trying to think of a question for a stupid person. Yeah. No, I just I I'm trying to oh, okay, um [03:11:32] Oh, what what type of animal? [03:11:35] Is a platypus like is it a mammal? Is it uh, what is it it falls into a specific category? [03:11:42] And there's only one other animal in it's this category [03:11:47] This is kind of arcane knowledge. This is annoying [03:11:49] Well, I can tell you what horses and goats and all that and what are they those are ungulates, right? Yeah, so this is like [03:11:56] Yeah, it's like you've got carnivore herbivore. I know it's like what is it starts with an m [03:12:01] It's not a mammal. It's a weird one [03:12:04] This feels all right. It's a mono. It's a monotreme. Yeah. No, I mean, yeah [03:12:09] And the echidna is the only other one. All right, and then we'll do one more. This is you asked me to ask you questions [03:12:16] It's too nerdy even for me. All right, uh last one [03:12:21] Okay, no, I've got this. All right, but that's zoology neurology. Okay. Um [03:12:29] I made a movie about this so I might know some but [03:12:33] I think I know more than I do. What's that neurological conditi\", \"'s that neurological condition called? [03:12:37] narcissism delusion [03:12:39] um [03:12:42] Hmm [03:12:46] What do you do you know a little history of neuroscience? I mean, no [03:12:50] I'm trying to ask you a question. I think uh, I can name the female neurologists that you named during this spot guest [03:12:57] Oh, cool. Nancy and Karla [03:12:59] Wow, so that's impressive. I wouldn't have been able to do that for knowledge. I didn't have oh really? [03:13:03] That's really yeah, Nancy can't wish her color shouts. That's great. Um, I remember the last names. That's no, that's really good. Um [03:13:10] Anyway, we don't have to [03:13:12] What's that? Oh, what are the spaces in the brain like the holes like the ones that have fluid in them that are meant to be there [03:13:18] You know those like things are [03:13:20] I know the benzo diazepans make holes in your brain [03:13:27] Do you need a new r.a. I feel like [03:13:30] You can I teach your in your brain. I they're called ventricles. Anyway, this is you know, I know the word [03:13:36] This is getting really nerdy, but I like it. Anyway, I teach a neuroanatomy course. I teach neuroscience. Um,\", \"e. I teach neuroscience. Um, [03:13:41] I'll be happy to teach you whatever neuroscience you want to know. Um, uh [03:13:47] You could ask me questions about comedy. I'm not gonna know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, ask me three of those [03:13:51] I don't okay. Um, be gentle [03:13:54] I'm trying to think of one that are as difficult as the ones you just asked me those would be like [03:13:58] what was the name of [03:14:00] Steve Martin's first special or something. I don't even know that that would be arcane [03:14:05] Who is a [03:14:07] Yeah, this is hard. I got you're right. Yeah, that's so hard [03:14:10] I think it's because like rote memory for like what is what is not actually how your brain works [03:14:15] And it's also not how my brain works. I'm good at memorizing things [03:14:18] But more what we really try to emphasize today is like processes thinking about like logic and process how things fit together [03:14:24] And that's actually much more useful. Yeah than memorizing long lists of names or names of things [03:14:29] It's actually to know that a platypus is a monitoring is totally useless your hippocampus is smart [03:14:34] And just\", \"is smart [03:14:34] And just not and not yet. Can you remember your childhood phone number? [03:14:39] 202 well, well, I you sure you still want to give this out [03:14:43] Yeah, no, I'll do this. My mom's was after my parents got divorced, which is a traumatic event [03:14:47] Which might have been why I remembered it better. It was 202 625 7238 [03:14:51] Right. Totally useless now unless the number still exists. I can do it from [03:14:56] 202 237 [03:14:59] 7842 like I could do it if you gave it to me. I could do by muscle memory [03:15:04] So that's incredible, right? Because how long ago was that number active? [03:15:09] It's 30 years, but you pass numbers every day. Yeah, that you don't so [03:15:14] I mean that's stored in your brain. It's occupying real estate [03:15:16] So knowing some names of things in neuroscience and what they mean amygdala is ominous. It's useless. Yeah, I teach your anatomy [03:15:22] It's useful for me. It's useless. So so you get an a for adaptable for adaptability of knowledge [03:15:29] You got you an a for sort of wrote memory, but wrote memory is is useless in many cases [03:15:34] Is there anything to say? [03:15:\", \"ere anything to say? [03:15:36] Jay Z says if you want to memorize something you have to say it 18 times. Is there any [03:15:40] Did he say that? [03:15:41] Well, he says [03:15:42] He said something about like I remember this guy interviewed him and was like, how do you memorize your [03:15:46] lyrics or your songs or whatever he said you just say them 18 times [03:15:49] And I think there was supposedly some kind of logic to that. I think the more attention you can bring to something [03:15:54] um [03:15:56] The fewer repetitions it requires. Yeah, why can I why do I know all the songs from an elanis morset song that I haven't heard in [03:16:02] 20 years because they they get they grabbed some emotional state in you [03:16:07] Or the rhythm is easily encoded so that there was a cedal calling turned on in your brain at the time of encoding [03:16:13] It was because they had a cedal calling is like a highlighter [03:16:15] It was like this is important and you didn't have to [03:16:19] Your brain's like, you know [03:16:20] People will never forget that there's a guy named Fauci who has something to do with this covid communication thing ever [03:16:25\", \"ication thing ever [03:16:25] His name is forever embedded in your brain like him or hate him [03:16:28] His brain is for his name is forever embedded in your brain [03:16:31] You cannot expunge that unless you get brain damage and you damage your hippocampus because of how much it's cedal calling [03:16:36] We're producing right now. We're in a time of stress. It was coupled to a time when we were paying attention [03:16:42] That's how the brain works [03:16:44] I could do this all day and I frankly might [03:16:47] I'm tempted [03:16:49] This is my dream [03:16:50] So what do you want from people? [03:16:53] Like follow on instagram. Oh, I think maybe in general you asked me a lot of personal questions [03:16:58] Or you tried [03:17:00] What do I want you can really bob and weave his instagram is amazing [03:17:04] He does these videos just on little things here and there [03:17:07] I'm gonna make you get on the community app and give out your phone number to everybody [03:17:10] So you can start targeting videos and sending things out to people more specifically [03:17:14] But your instagram is amazing. Thank you. Yeah, I've really enjoyed teaching ne\", \"e really enjoyed teaching neuroscience on instagram [03:17:19] So it's huberman lab and I do some descriptions of neuroscience and psychology and biology a lot of the kinds of things [03:17:26] I was talking about today, but also a lot of actionable tools as they relate to stress management and sleep and light and [03:17:33] I host people on there like experts in [03:17:36] Sleep and circadian rhythm shift work autism and alzheimer's people like that are gonna be coming on people from my community [03:17:41] I'll do it. Um [03:17:43] Perfect. Yeah, perfect. So, um, yeah, that's where people can find me and um, I'm pretty easy [03:17:49] My email and stuff is pretty easily found on the web. What? Yeah, it's just the virtue [03:17:53] It's just the way academics exist in the world, you know, finally, why don't you tell everyone since we um [03:18:00] Mention at the beginning, but then ignored it of our how we met or how we are from past [03:18:07] Right. So right this is this is the second time we've met with a with a uh, a gap in between of three years [03:18:14] I always have a microphone in front of me [03:18:17] Three years ago on new year's I was in p\", \"ago on new year's I was in portland visiting friends [03:18:21] And I went to go see you do stand-up that night. It was new year's eve [03:18:26] And who I a woman who I thought was your twin sister not because you looked exactly alike [03:18:31] But because you told everybody she was your twin sister [03:18:34] Jumped up out of the audience and got on stage with you and [03:18:38] That was kind of the closing act. But anyway, the act was super funny and it wasn't a closing act [03:18:42] I was a surprise to me too. Oh wait. I had no idea she was gonna be there. I thought no, I never met her before [03:18:47] I thought it was all right. I'm totally confused. No, this is wild women are confusing. I know it's a nightmare [03:18:52] I went to portland was performing on new year's eve. I think I was running a special [03:18:56] This must have been my hbo special or something. I think I was dating someone in portland at the time [03:19:00] We all make mistakes and uh, was it a mistake because of who they were because they were in portland [03:19:06] I have an I have an indefensive portland. I love portland. I haven't been there recently [03:19:10] I know it's\", \"ently [03:19:10] I know it's a city it's struggling with a lot of issues right now, but well, it's not that big of a thing [03:19:15] Apparently the news is kind of blowing it up. I have to assume those cameras don't extend across all the blocks and yeah [03:19:20] It feels like it's it's a little clickbaity at this point, but no, I love portland [03:19:25] Very deeply and so and the crowds there are just so fucking smart and great [03:19:29] So I think I went there because I was trying to run my special right before I shot it because portland's always just a great judge [03:19:35] Like they're smart [03:19:36] They're incisive, but they still like to have fun and party and they don't take themselves too seriously [03:19:40] So it's a great place to run a special [03:19:41] I was doing new year shows are tough like it's a lot of pressure [03:19:45] Yeah, people want the crescendo end to their year and you have to like save marriages in that show [03:19:50] Like this is like like you can tell there's so much pressure on you to be a great, you know [03:19:56] Uh performance for a date, you know, like it's just like they paid money [03:19:59] It's their new\", \"ey [03:19:59] It's their new year's you know [03:20:00] So it's like always just like a little bit stressful to do new year shows and I show up to the venue [03:20:05] and I'm like I'm a little bit like dressed up because [03:20:08] It's a new year show and I walk in and the bouncer looks at me and is like, what are you doing? [03:20:12] And I was like, what do you mean? What are you doing? [03:20:13] Like what are you talking about? He's like, what are you doing here? [03:20:14] And I was like, what are you doing here? That's my show [03:20:16] What are you talking about? And he was so weirded out and he was so aggressive with me [03:20:19] And I didn't show what was going on and then I go upstairs and the second bouncer's like, hey [03:20:22] Well, how did why are you in this room? And I was like, what is happening? [03:20:25] Like it was the other I was I was so like why is everyone asking me what I'm doing and where I'm going [03:20:31] And people look like they had seen a ghost when they saw me walk in and then what I go on stage [03:20:37] And New Year's Eve shows never go particularly well. So I'm not convinced. [03:20:40] It was a really good sho\", \"40] It was a really good show. Thank you. [03:20:42] I didn't know that we were going to interact later three years later. [03:20:46] I'm surprised that it made fun of you. How were you close to the front? [03:20:48] I was right up front. [03:20:50] Really? Yeah. [03:20:51] And I didn't make fun of you. I didn't talk to you at all. [03:20:53] No, I was prepared for you to do that because I've been to one or two other comedy shows. [03:20:57] I'm shocked. [03:20:58] Oh, it's right there. Yeah. Maybe you're in panoramic vision. [03:21:01] Wow, maybe. [03:21:03] Yeah, no, I would have said because I would have been like what are you doing? [03:21:05] You've been like a neurologist and I would have been like, oh my god, you're like... [03:21:08] We would have had this discussion, but then you were sat down. [03:21:11] Because you look like a Marvel scientist. You look like a... [03:21:15] I look like a neurologist. [03:21:17] Yes, a neurologist like in a Marvel movie. You know what I mean? [03:21:19] That's just what you look like too. [03:21:20] So I'm sure I would have not believed that you were a neurologist. [03:21:24] But so I get on stage and I don't k\", \"I get on stage and I don't know what's happening. [03:21:26] I'm like going to get a drink of water or something. [03:21:28] And then a girl just yells out. [03:21:29] She's like, our friend looks exactly like you. [03:21:32] And I was like, okay. [03:21:32] And for some reason, maybe it's because it was New Year's Eve and the vibe was good. [03:21:37] And I was like, all right, fine. Just have her come up here. [03:21:41] When people tell me that I look like them and always ends up hurting my feelings. [03:21:43] But I was just like, come up, come on. [03:21:44] And she came up and truly... [03:21:47] You look similar. I wouldn't say you were identical twins. [03:21:50] Maybe you were dichorionic, not monochorionic, [03:21:52] transmembrarily. [03:21:54] Yes, I do remember that. [03:21:56] No, I wasn't producing acetylcholine, so I don't remember. [03:21:58] But she came up and it was such a... [03:22:01] The audience went crazy. [03:22:02] I had never seen her before and the bouncers had seen her walk in [03:22:06] and then seen me walk in five minutes later. [03:22:08] Also that night, her hair was done similar to yours. [03:22:11] Didn't I make her g\", \"3:22:11] Didn't I make her get on stage and get out in the microphone? [03:22:14] And you guys took a picture together. [03:22:15] And I was convinced that she was actually your twin sister. [03:22:18] No. [03:22:18] Because you said so. [03:22:19] No. [03:22:20] You're like, it's my twin. [03:22:21] And then I was like, oh, I guess they're twins. [03:22:23] And then the person that I was at... [03:22:24] Maybe I had met her before. [03:22:26] I think she came to my book, a book signing a couple years prior. [03:22:30] So maybe by the time you saw, I had met her before. [03:22:32] And then two days later or something, we were talking about it. [03:22:35] The person I went to the show with and then we're like... [03:22:37] You guys were like obsessed with me. [03:22:39] Wow, okay. [03:22:41] The person I went with was... [03:22:44] Okay. [03:22:45] The person... [03:22:45] You were just talking about how pretty I am? [03:22:46] No. [03:22:47] All right. [03:22:47] Well, so I'm a nascent fan of comedy. [03:22:54] All right, I'll just say it. [03:22:55] I didn't know who you were before that night. [03:22:57] I'm sorry. [03:22:58] I didn't know. [03:22:59] \", \"] I didn't know. [03:22:59] I didn't know. [03:22:59] I'm a scientist. [03:23:00] I didn't know. [03:23:02] Like I knew who Lenny Bruce was. [03:23:04] Your hippocampus is a mess. [03:23:05] Like Eddie Murphy. [03:23:07] Like I've been in a lab a lot of years. [03:23:09] But the person that I was with at the time was like really excited about your work. [03:23:13] And so I got tickets and that was the first night. [03:23:17] I mean, people have to come to the table sooner or later. [03:23:19] Yeah, yeah. [03:23:19] No, I get a lot of guys that meet me for the first time because their girl [03:23:23] like drags them to come see me. [03:23:24] And it's like, you have to come see Whitney. [03:23:26] And they're like, I didn't want to. [03:23:27] I really did not want to see a female comic. [03:23:30] And then the show was great. [03:23:32] I became a fan. [03:23:33] I thought that was your twin sister until two days later. [03:23:36] The person I was there with revealed to me that, no, that wasn't actually her sister. [03:23:40] That was just a spontaneous thing. [03:23:42] And it took me a couple of minutes to really adjust [03:23:44] because I had to refr\", \"23:44] because I had to reframe all the stuff that had happened. [03:23:46] That's weird. [03:23:47] I mean, I mean, it wasn't like hugely impactful in my life. [03:23:49] But I attached. [03:23:50] It's all you think about. [03:23:51] I had attached enough. [03:23:52] I had attached enough to it that it kind of threw me for a loop. [03:23:56] Actful. [03:23:57] So it was a really funny show. [03:24:01] And then and then three years later, I think it was after the Rogan podcast [03:24:06] and you asked a question and we started talking about neuroscience. [03:24:08] And well, actually, we met because my therapist who hates everyone told me about you. [03:24:13] Do you realize that that probably means that she hates me? [03:24:15] Is that what you're? [03:24:15] No, she loves you. [03:24:17] Oh, OK. [03:24:17] Pot twist. [03:24:18] The way the way you. [03:24:18] She thinks everyone's bullshit. [03:24:20] She's like, don't read that self-help book. [03:24:21] That one's not true. [03:24:22] That's not real science. [03:24:23] That's not attachment strategy. [03:24:24] Like she's constantly like debunking a lot of the things that I, you know, [03:24:29] I'\", \"t I, you know, [03:24:29] I'm exploring and she's like, don't read that. [03:24:31] Don't do that. [03:24:31] That doesn't work. [03:24:32] That doesn't make sense. [03:24:32] Well, there's some crazy stuff out there. [03:24:33] There's some crazy shit out there. [03:24:34] And I certainly don't have all the answers. [03:24:36] I just happen to put a scientific lens on. [03:24:39] No, but she loves you and she told me to start following you on Instagram. [03:24:43] OK. [03:24:43] Well, whoever she is, thank you. [03:24:45] And I'm glad that you did because this was. [03:24:46] Yeah, I don't think that. [03:24:47] I don't think she wants people to publicly know she's my therapist. [03:24:51] Probably would be. [03:24:53] Yeah, I work with Whitney Cummings. [03:24:55] That makes you that makes you that makes you the witness test of whether or not she [03:24:59] could depend on how well you're doing or not. [03:25:02] That's what I'm saying. [03:25:03] I don't think she wants me to be her like storefront. [03:25:06] I don't think she wants me to be the example of her work. [03:25:09] And it's a lot of pressure on you, too, because if you don't, something ha\", \"e if you don't, something happens. [03:25:13] I know. [03:25:13] Yeah. [03:25:13] Yeah. [03:25:14] So I'm not going to say, but so follow him, watch the Rogan podcast. [03:25:18] If you have not already was so informative, so clear. [03:25:21] You're so good at doing this. [03:25:22] I hope you'll still how many videos a week are you doing? [03:25:25] I try and do two or three weeks. [03:25:26] Some are longer and they take longer to digest. [03:25:28] And there's some, you know, it's impossible to have a really good [03:25:31] discussion about science without including the names of some brain areas and things like that. [03:25:35] And I believe, you know, there's a famous scientist, Max Tillbrook, that said, [03:25:39] assume zero knowledge and infinite intelligence. [03:25:41] I'm not sure I completely agree with that. [03:25:43] But in teaching, I just assume people don't know anything about the topic [03:25:46] so they can show up without any prior knowledge, [03:25:48] but that if they're delivered the information in a way that's reasonable [03:25:51] and thoughtful that hopefully they'll take away some kernels of information. [03:25:55] Such a fan.\"]\n",

I do get star-struck by neuroscientists and neurology professors So you this this actually is a very big deal for me ask the producers I changed did I not wear a dress and then change into something else before he got here I I Put a dress on and then I started sweating and panicking so then I took it off and now I'm put a sweater on which was even Dumber, so I'm fully flustered. I want to just say that out loud. I don't get flustered by celebrities I get flustered by scientists People that listen to this podcast know that I'm obsessed with neurology In fact, I believe I know more than you do And you very very well may and if you disagree with anything I say, I'll just cut it out That's good. So this is like a crazy honor for me. Do you want to just introduce yourself? So I don't screw it up Sure. Well, first of all, it's great to be here. Thanks for the invitation My name is Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neuroscience and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine So neuroscience unlike neurology is not the clinical field So I should just give a disclaimer right off the bat. So I'm not a medical doctor That means I'm not an MD, which means I don't prescribe anything. Damn it I'm a research scientist and a professor. So I profess a lot of things and People that know me know that this podcast like this is fulfilling the promise of what I wanted to do with this podcast Which was get these brilliant minds in a room picking their brain I wanted to be like the Robin Hood of science and neurology and Therapy and psychotherapy and psychology and stuff so that People could get this information because I'm lucky enough to be able to meet people like you And I wanted to give them an opportunity to get inside your head for free. So this is like my dream I also just want to say real quick that Andrew was just on Rogan. It was a brilliant interview I'm gonna try \n",

They introduce their guest, Andrew Huberman, a professor of neuroscience at Stanford School of Medicine. They clarify that they are not a medical doctor but a research scientist and professor. The speaker emphasizes their goal of sharing information and insights from experts with their audience for free. They also mention Andrew's recent interview with Joe Rogan.\n",
            "CHUNK: st want to say real quick that Andrew was just on Rogan. It was a brilliant interview I'm gonna try to not cover a lot of the same things you guys talked about this podcast is more through the lens of Sex relationships good relationships bad relationships family relationships a work situation sort of how to edify yourself in all parts Opposed to like athletic performance or something. We don't care about working out over here But so I'm gonna keep guiding towards that I recommend that everybody listen to the Rogan interview it's unbelievably Educational and elegant your it's it's very rare that you're able to get a scientist or doctor who is Charismatic and able to convey what they know in a way that people that aren't scientists can understand Thank you, you know, so you like you make it simple enough for dumb people like me to actually understand I'm gonna know you know a lot of neuroscience. We were talking out there. You know a lot about science and science history I'm not just saying that like your knowledge is pretty bad. I true. I am obsessed spend time on it I it's my house It's my number one passion is neurology and and let me tell you why it's just so we can frame this Podcast in this conversation because this is like this is such a big deal for me And I'm I'm just so excited, you know, I've spent a lot of my life and I'm not gonna say it's just because I'm a woman I think men, you know get this to we're taught at a very young age that everything is our fault And we're taught, you know, I think as as a woman you hear a lot relax calm down your psycho You're crazy. You're too emotional. You're too sensitive, you know, I think for the longest time I didn't really understand why I made the decisions. I made I just thought I Was bad in some way and once I started learning about neurology I actually think it's like a crime that we don't teach neurology in high schools to understand how your brain works and a lot of the Decisions that are made for you instead of your conscious decisions and Now, you know, I t\n",

            "SUMMARIZED: Andrew recently had an interview with Rogan which was highly recommended as an educational and elegant conversation. The focus of this podcast is on sex, relationships, and personal development. The speaker expresses admiration for Andrew's ability to simplify complex neuroscience topics. They discuss the importance of understanding neurology to make conscious decisions and break free from societal expectations.\n",
            "CHUNK: ot of the Decisions that are made for you instead of your conscious decisions and Now, you know, I think learning neurology helped me have so much more patience with myself and so much more Love and respect for myself of going like, okay, you know, I'm really upset in the situation But that's adrenaline and cortisol and you know This reaction is something that would have served me very well in tribal times Like my brain is very well evolved for a conflict, you know, a thousand years ago but circumstances have changed and now this tool is obsolete and Even maybe a liability at this point So being able to look at your choices and your reactions and your emotions through the lens of understanding neurology to me It's just like the key to being patient with yourself the key to being hopeful Especially some of the work that you're doing around neuroplasticity the key to going like, you know I can change Myself I don't I'm not doomed to turn into my mother I'm not doomed to constantly recreate my childhood circumstances Like I'm not doomed to be in bad relationships forever, you know So to me, this is the key to feeling hope and patience and self-respect and love So this is just it's such a big deal for me. Well, it's the right topic if you're interested in Yourself or if people are interested in themselves and or interested in other people what makes them tick Mm-hmm. I mean the nervous system, which is the brain and all the connections with the body and back again Essentially controls all our experience. I mean everything the immune system digestion heartbeat gut microbiome All that stuff is great and important But it's actually all controlled by the nervous system in the brain and it's amazing how little we you know It's just so shocking to me that when I do talk about, you know I'm obsessed with weighted blankets and you know whether it's placebo or not But when my sympathetic nervous system is activated I'm like, I need to get into my parasympathetic numbers. Like, what does that mean? And I'm like, how is this no\n",

            "SUMMARIZED: Learning about neurology has helped the speaker have more patience, love, and respect for themselves. They acknowledge that their brain's reactions and emotions may have been useful in the past, but are now outdated. Understanding neurology allows them to make conscious choices and change their patterns. It brings hope, patience, self-respect, and love. The nervous system, which controls our experiences, including the immune system and digestion, is controlled by the brain. The speaker finds it shocking how little people know about the connection between the brain and the body.\n",
            "CHUNK: need to get into my parasympathetic numbers. Like, what does that mean? And I'm like, how is this not just part of our every day Conversation of how we talk to each other. Yeah, so there are a couple reasons why I think people don't know more about the brain Probably three reasons one is that a lot of the best information is recent Mm-hmm only really come out in the last 10 to 15 years The second reason is that there aren't a lot of scientists who are leaving their laboratories and talking to the general public Yes, they're busy. Yeah, and of the ones that do They vary in terms of how narrowly focused they are or how much of the field they read about and understand I'm you know part of the reason I'm here and I've been doing podcasts as I really I want to be an educator I want to teach people about themselves and about the brain and I think I would like to also put out the call for more scientists to do similar sorts of things And then the third reason is that the naming is terrible. So as you pointed out sympathetic nervous system is like It actually is the kind of more stress related aspect of the autonomic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system Which means automatic isn't even an automatic. It's not autonomic. And so the naming is terrible So medical nomenclature and science nomenclature is not it's just it's designed so that everyone's on the same page Who works on that particular thing? Right and it almost seems as if it's designed to keep everybody else out of some secret club But it's not it's just the naming is terrible So for those of you out there that are listening this I and because you brought it up the sympathetic nervous system is the aspect of our Brain and its connections with the body that makes us feel more alert It makes our breathing speed up that makes us kind of stressed And the parasympathetic nervous system is the one that makes us more calm the so-called rest and digest system it's the one that triggers sexual arousal incidentally, so they're now no one will forget it and Litera\n",
            "\n",
            "SUMMARIZED: People often don't know much about the brain for three main reasons. Firstly, a lot of the best information about the brain has only come out in the last 10 to 15 years. Secondly, not many scientists are leaving their laboratories to share their knowledge with the general public. And even when they do, they vary in how much they understand and can explain. The third reason is that the naming conventions in medical and scientific fields are confusing. For example, the sympathetic nervous system, which is actually associated with stress, and the autonomic nervous system, which is not truly automatic. This lack of clarity can make it difficult for non-experts to understand. However, the sympathetic nervous system makes us feel alert and stressed, while the parasympathetic nervous system calms us down and is also responsible for sexual arousal.\n",
            "CHUNK: s the one that triggers sexual arousal incidentally, so they're now no one will forget it and Literally, these are two different, you know, your sympathetic nervous system is just from here to your navel It's the neurons that trigger the all that activation and the release of adrenaline Everything right here and the parasympathetic nervous system para just means near Simpa means together So it all happens at once. That's why stress is like boom all it You have to know Latin in order to figure these basic or Greek Yeah, that's too much and then the parasympathetic nervous system is the neck it's the neurons that live along the spinal cord in the neck and in the pelvic area below the navel and Those control other things right many other things and so like voice reproductive behavior Defocation urination all these kinds of things so But the naming is just dreadful and so one of the things that I'm trying to do and I'm rallying my colleagues to do is to try And come up with a nomenclature yeah that can evolve to a place where more people can understand it It's gonna take some time because doctors need to speak doctor speak and scientists need to speak science speak But I think it is important today I'll do my best to not use many and hopefully no acronyms, but we don't need more acronyms But if I do use them all Be careful to and you do a great job at saying like the fear center of the brain the reward center of the brain I try you know I did a movie on about neurology and it took me. I'm not even joking you a week to learn the word fennel ethyl I mean, I Literally just walked around my house like fennel ethyl like it was like it's actually Physically difficult it's a mouthful and then you know people would you know will contact me and say well You know you were lumping this and this together I think there's a way to have a conversation about science neuroscience neurology immunology in a way that My hope is that it'll be clear and that will also some elements will be actionable because I think information is great B\n",
            "\n",
            "SUMMARIZED: The sympathetic nervous system triggers sexual arousal and the release of adrenaline. The parasympathetic nervous system controls other functions such as voice, reproductive behavior, and elimination. The naming convention for these systems needs improvement to make it more accessible. Doctors and scientists should strive to communicate in a way that is understandable to the general public. Using acronyms should be avoided. Understanding brain functions can be challenging, but clear and actionable information is important in the fields of science and medicine.\n",
            "CHUNK:  be clear and that will also some elements will be actionable because I think information is great But there are great tools to extract from the field of neuroscience that people can implement Regardless of financial status, etc. They can make their lives better and can help each other And so I guess I'm basically saying I agree. I think that more people need to understand science I'm heavily biased in in my belief in that but Anyway, but I just know I want people to like because people often look to me As some like mental health Guru and how did you learn to love yourself and how did you learn to have high self-esteem and how did you learn to? Avoid conflict and you know we say a lot on this show like the only way to win is to not play Don't get into the ring Don't you know if someone asks you to dance just don't like all of sort of the ability to control your impulses You know is something the ability to have something that we call pause the ability to say I'm not gonna engage in this fight You know I'm not gonna respond to this email right now to not be so reactive because I think especially now With what's going on and we're all at like, you know peak stress Peak aggravation. We're all very reactive and you know to me the key to my life having Serenity and the key to me having integrity and pride is the ability to choose The actions that I take and before I learned about neurology. I don't feel like I had a big choice I would respond to that text message before I thought I would answer the phone before I was like Do I really want to take this call like I didn't have the ability to control my behavior in my reactions And I would make decisions in you know with my head flooded with adrenaline or flooded with dopamine You know I look at a lot of Let's just say bad relationships and I look back and I'm like I was just on drugs Like I look back and some of the decisions that I made under the influence of oxytocin And it helps me forgive myself. It helps me have more patience for the bad decisions I've made but it \n",
